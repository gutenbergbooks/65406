<p><span class="smcap">Tinned</span> meats and provisions may be regarded
from two distinct points of view. The
majority of persons, especially in this country,
look upon them simply as a convenience to
housekeepers, but the subject should be
regarded from a far higher point than one of
mere convenience, for by means of tinned
provisions the whole food supply of the world
is increased, and thereby the happiness and
enjoyment of mankind at large.</p>

<p>By means of tinned meats the superfluities
of one country help the deficiencies of others.
Owing to this useful invention, no longer are
sheep slaughtered for their wool and tallow
only, and the carcasses wasted, but the whole
is utilised. It should be
borne in mind that economy
in the use of food is a duty
clearly pointed out to us by
the highest of all authority.
The age of miracles has
passed, but were it in our
power to multiply our food
miraculously, we are taught
that it would still be a duty
to gather up the fragments
that remain, that nothing be
lost.</p>

<p>At present I will confine
myself to the consideration
of tinned meats in relation to
their value to housekeepers,
and I will illustrate my subject
by supposing the following
case, which is by no
means a rare one in England
in the present day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">{178}</span></p>

<p>There are, throughout the length and
breadth of the land, many hundreds of little
quiet country villages which, to a certain extent,
may be said to be isolated from civilised life.
There is the village inn, alas! generally more
than one; the village shop, a few scattered
houses and outlying farms. But for all
practical purposes the well-to-do inhabitants
are dependent for their supplies on the
carrier’s cart, which takes a journey into the
neighbouring town, some four or five miles
distant.</p>

<p>The village shop generally supplies the
inhabitants with bread; probably they will
kill a pig on Thursday or Friday, and supply
the usual dish of pork for Sunday’s dinner.
They also will usually be found to deal in
cheap crockery, needles and cotton, sweetstuff,
candles, pickles, etc. The only means
of communication with the neighbouring town
is, as I have said, the carrier’s cart, which
generally takes a few passengers. I have
lately lived in a little village myself, and have
travelled by the same hooded conveyance
backwards and forwards, never without
thinking of the lazy horse associated with
David Copperfield; and, indeed, at times I
have felt inclined to chalk up in the corner,
“Barkis is willin’.” The carrier usually
takes his orders the night before, starts at an
early hour in the morning, and returns in time
to supply the dinner-table. Let us suppose
that he has brought with him a shoulder of
mutton, and that, instead of dining late, as
is our wont, we, on this particular day, dine
early. Shortly before our usual dinner hour,
we are suddenly alarmed by the astounding
news, “Oh, mamma, Mr. Smith has arrived;
what are we to do?” Hospitality is a duty,
and were I cynically inclined, I would imagine
Mr. Smith to be a rich old bachelor uncle,
very fond of good living, from whom we had
great expectations; but I would rather put
this supposititious case. Suppose Mr. Smith to
be an old friend of our father who has seen
better days, in which he showed us many
little acts of kindness. Under these circumstances
he is, of all men in the world, the very
last one to whom we should like to give the
“cold shoulder.” What is to be done?</p>

<p>We will suppose that our housekeeper, or
whoever acts as such, has, in anticipation of
such contingencies, laid in a little stock of tinned
goods, which are safely put by in the store
closet. Having welcomed our guest, and
whispered a few words to the cook and those
willing to assist her, we will calmly sit down
to our table, take a sheet of paper, and commence
as follows:—</p>

<ul class="center">
<li><span class="smcap">Menu.</span></li>
<li>Ox Tail Soup.</li>
<li>Salmon Mayonnaise.</li>
<li>Hashed Mutton and Pickled Walnuts.</li>
<li>Curried Rabbit.</li>
<li>Asparagus.</li>
<li>Plum Pudding.      Brandy Sauce.</li>
<li>Jelly in glasses.</li>
<li>Pine Apple (whole in syrup).</li>
</ul>

<p>If the cook is smart, the whole dinner
could be served easily within an hour, and
should one or two of the girls in the house be
willing to assist (and who would not, under
such circumstances?), the dinner might be
sent to table in considerably less time. I can
imagine some of my readers glancing over the
bill of fare I have just written, and saying to
themselves, “What a lot of saucepans we
shall want on the fire at the same time!”
This, however, is not the case; for I would
remind you that one of the first points to learn
in connection with the serving of tinned meats
is that they should be warmed up in the tin
before it is opened. We can, therefore, perform
the astonishing trick of making hot our
ox-tail soup, our curried rabbit, our asparagus,
and our plum pudding in the same
saucepan at the same time.</p>

<p>I must, however, commence at the beginning.
Our store cupboard is supposed to
contain the following provisions in tins:—Ox-tail
soup, preserved salmon, mayonnaise
sauce, curried rabbit, asparagus, plum pudding,
pine apple in syrup, as well as a bottle
of jelly. I may, however, mention, with regard
to the mayonnaise sauce, that should you
have a bottle of oil in the house and a couple
of eggs, it would be better to make some fresh
sauce from the egg and oil direct. Our cupboard
will also contain a bottle of pickled
walnuts, a bottle of capers, a bottle of olives,
and a bottle of anchovies.</p>

<p>Of course we commence dinner with the
soup, unless we happen to have in the house a
Brunswick sausage, in which case a few thin
slices of Brunswick sausage may be placed in
a plate with a few of the anchovies, capers,
olives, and a little pat of butter, as there are
many persons who like to commence dinner
with what is known as a <i>hors d’œuvre</i>, and I
do not know a better mixture than the one I
have named.</p>

<p>But to return to the soup. In my opinion,
of all provisions sold in tins at present, the
soups are the greatest failures.</p>

<p>This is very much to be regretted; but there
is a good old saying, that we must always
make the best of a bad job. As a rule, the
thick soups are better than the clear, and although
I have mentioned ox-tail soup, I will
later on give a list of the soups from which
you may take your choice. Fortunately, all
thick soups in tins can be very greatly improved
by a very simple method. Make the
thick soup hot in the tin, take the tin out of
the hot water, open it, and pour the contents
into a saucepan. Of course, if there are many
persons to dinner, it would be necessary to
warm up two tins, or even more. I will now
describe the contents of the tin. The soup
itself is not exactly thick, nor is it exactly
clear. The bones of the tail, instead of being
surrounded by the meat, are quite bare, and it
looks as if the bone and the meat had had a
quarrel, and they had mutually agreed never
to speak to one another again, while the bone
itself recalls a game known as “knuckle-bones.”
To every pint of soup in the saucepan
add as follows: a brimming dessertspoonful
of brown thickening, or what French
cooks know as brown roux. This brown roux
looks like light-coloured chocolate. It keeps
good for months, is very cheap, very useful,
and I will describe how to make it by-and-by.
Add, also, a brimming teaspoonful of extract
of meat and half a glass of sherry. The effect
of adding the brown roux is that when the
roux is crumbled into the soup and gently
stirred over the fire till it boils, it makes the
soup thicker than it was before. It also makes
it darker in colour, richer in flavour, and makes
the divorce between the meat and the bone
less conspicuous.</p>

<p>The extract of meat also greatly adds to
its nutritious properties, and gives additional
colour. The sherry gives it flavour. Were I
going to take the soup myself, I should also
add a little cayenne pepper and lemon-juice,
but we must be very cautious how we use
cayenne, unless we know the taste of our
guests.</p>

<p>We will next consider the salmon mayonnaise.
As this is all cold, we should naturally
see to the hot things first, and we will,
therefore, suppose that the ox-tail soup,
the curried rabbit, the asparagus, and the
plum pudding are all getting hot in the
saucepan. First open the tin of salmon.
Turn the contents entirely out. If there is
any liquid, throw it away, and, as far as possible,
absorb all the moisture of the salmon in a dry
cloth before placing it in a dish. Make the
surface, as far as possible, oval, and raised in
the middle, and then pour the sauce with a
spoon gently over the top, so that it looks like
a custard pudding. If the season of the year
is suitable, and we have some lettuces in our
garden, of course we should cut one or two
lettuces, and surround the salmon with the
best part of the lettuce. Next to ornament
the salad. Take a bottle of capers, and with
a spoon take out about a couple of dozen,
throw these into a cloth and dry them, and
place them at intervals on the sauce. Then
take three or four anchovies out of the bottle,
cut them into strips, remove the bone, and
place these little strips of anchovy round the
base of the light pyramid of sauce like trellis
work. A dozen olives may be placed also
round the base of the salad, the stone being
removed with a knife. This is done by taking
not too sharp a knife and cutting the olive
sideways, keeping the blade of the knife always
in contact with the stone of the olive. When
the stone is removed the olive assumes its
original shape, of course with a hole in the
middle where the stone has been. Now take
a little piece of parsley and chop up enough,
say, to cover a shilling or a little more. Place
this on the tip of a knife and shake it gently
over the mayonnaise sauce, so that the little
green specks of parsley fall naturally. Now
take a bottle of cochineal, supposing you have
one—cochineal can be bought at sixpence
a bottle, and keeps good for months, or even
years—and drop a few drops in a plate or
saucer; take a little piece of dry bread
and make about a saltspoonful of fine breadcrumbs.
Throw these dry breadcrumbs into
the saucer with the cochineal, and shake them.
This will cause the breadcrumbs to turn red.
These can be shaken over the mayonnaise like
the chopped parsley, and we shall have a very
bright-looking dish. The green lettuce round
the edge, the raised surface of the salmon
covered with the yellow mayonnaise sauce in
the middle, which is decorated round the base
with the anchovies and olives, and on the top
the capers and the little green and red specks,
which contrast nicely with the yellow. If you
have no lettuce or salad of any kind to put
round the base, you can ornament the edge
with hard-boiled eggs cut in quarters, and a
sprig of parsley between each piece.</p>

<p>Our next dish is the hashed mutton and
pickled walnuts. This scarcely comes in the
category of tinned meats. The mutton we
had for dinner was probably in a semi-cold
and flabby state when our guest arrived. Were
I going to make the hashed mutton, I should
commence by slicing up a couple of onions,
browning them in a frying-pan with a little
butter, then pouring in the remains of all
the gravy that had been left from the joint,
cutting the mutton into slices, and warming
them up in this gravy, taking care it does
not boil; and as the gravy would be rather
poor, as soon as the soup was got ready I
should add two or three tablespoonfuls of the
soup to the hashed mutton. And let me remind
you of another very great improvement.
Add, as well, a dessertspoonful of Harvey
sauce, after shaking the bottle. You can toast
a piece of bread a nice brown, as you would
not have time to fry any bread, which is
better. Cut the toast into round pieces, and
place them round the hash alternately with
the pickled walnuts cut in half. Do not send
the hashed mutton to table in a great, big
dish, large enough to hold a round of beef,
but serve it in a deep dish—a vegetable dish,
for instance. By this means it keeps hot
longer, and looks more appetising.</p>

<p>Our next dish is the curried rabbit. First
class curry can be obtained in tins. Remember
that tinned meats are like everything else
in the world—some are good, and some are
bad. If you wish for a bottle of really good
wine, you must go to a first class wine merchant;
and if you wish your tinned provisions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">{179}</span>
good, you must get them from first class
people, or see that some well-known name is
on the label. Unfortunately, this country has
been flooded, from time to time, with worthless
imitations, introduced by unknown men
who have no name to lose.</p>

<p>The curry, having been made hot in the tin,
should be turned out in a deep dish; and here
again I would recommend a vegetable dish.
Boiled rice should be served with it in a
separate dish, and the rice should be handed
before the curry. If you have any chutney in
the house, the chutney should be served with
the curry, like they do on board the P. &amp; O.
boats, which are so famed for their oriental
curry cooks. When the curry has been turned
out into the dish, you might add a few fresh
bayleaves and serve them up in the curry
whole, and if you feel anxious to have the dish
ornamental you can proceed as follows, and,
should your guest be an “old Indian,” he
will probably appreciate the addition:—Take
some red chilis and bend each chili in the
middle, so as to make it look like one of the
small claws of a lobster, and place these red
chilies round the edge of the dish in a triangular
shape, exactly as if you were placing
the small claws of a lobster around a lobster
salad mayonnaise.</p>

<p>The asparagus should be served as a course
by itself. When the tin is sufficiently hot,
which it will be a few minutes after the water
has boiled, take it out and open it, pour off
the liquid, and serve the asparagus on a piece
of toast. A little butter sauce should be
handed round with it.</p>

<p>Butter sauce is best made by simply thickening,
say, half a pint of water (not milk) with
a little butter and flour mixed together.
When the water is sufficiently thick, add some
more butter to the hot, thickened water till
it becomes rich and oily.</p>

<p>As soon as you have handed round the
butter sauce with the asparagus, take the
tureen down-stairs, and let the cook put back
the butter sauce in the saucepan for a minute,
and add a tablespoonful of moist sugar, a
tablespoonful of rum, and two tablespoonfuls
of brandy. By this means we avoid waste,
and make the same sauce do twice. If you
don’t approve of spirits being used in the
kitchen (I don’t approve of it myself), add a
little sherry, and rub a few lumps of sugar on
the outside of a lemon, and also two drops of
essence of almonds. (You can, indeed, leave
out the sherry, and still have a good sauce.)</p>

<p>The plum pudding will be hot through after
the water has boiled for over half an hour.
Open the tin, take out the pudding, and serve
with a little sauce poured over it, and the
rest in a tureen.</p>

<p>The jelly should be served in glasses, for
the simple reason that there is no time to
melt the jelly. Open the bottle, and rake out
sufficient jelly with a bent skewer to fill the
glasses.</p>

<p>The pineapple, whole, in addition to the
usual stock of almonds and raisins, figs, biscuits,
&amp;c., makes a first-class dessert.</p>

<p>It is perhaps needless to add that as a rule
all these dishes are not necessary for one
dinner; but I wish to show what can be done
in order to avoid giving your friends the
“cold shoulder.”</p>

</div>
<p><span class="uppercase">he</span> secret of Fairy’s
parentage died
with Dame Hursey,
and for the
next two or three
years she lived
quietly on with
the Shelleys,
nothing more
remarkable than
the finding of some rare bird, or an
occasional tiff with Jack, the Lewes
carnival on the fifth of November,
and the sheep washing and shearing
every June, occurring to vary the monotony
of her happy life. She was
naturally a bright, happy little creature,
not much given to thinking, and if she
sometimes wondered who she was and
where she came from, she never allowed
the matter to distress her; she had the
Shelleys, and they all worshipped her,
and if she wanted other friends she was
always welcome at the Rectory, where
she still continued to go every day for
her lessons. As to the future, it is
doubtful if she ever gave it a thought;
she lived as all children do, for the
present, at least, as far as this world is
concerned, though neither she nor any
one else could have been brought up by
good John Shelley without learning that
life here is but a preparation for the life
to come. Ignorant as the shepherd
was in many things, he was by no
means ignorant in things spiritual, and
his knowledge of the Bible, large
portions of which he knew by heart,
would have put many an educated man
and woman to shame. It was a favourite
amusement of Fairy’s and the boys on
long Sunday winter evenings, when there
was no service at church, and after John
had read the evening service to them, as
he invariably did, to start him off in
some chapter and see how long he would
go on without stopping, saying it by
rote. He always carried a small Bible
in his pocket, and during his long days
with the sheep, he had plenty of opportunities
of studying it; and he studied
it to some purpose, for he was a fine
character. Faults he may have had, but
you might have known him a long time
before you discovered them. Mrs.
Shelley, who had better opportunities of
judging than anyone else, would have
said he liked his own way too much;
and that, for such a wise man as he was,
it was surprising how easily he allowed a
little thing like Fairy, whom he always
had spoilt, to get over him; but it is
doubtful whether in her heart of hearts
she considered either of these faults.</p>

<p>If he had any pride in his composition
it was entirely professional, and when
one May evening, sixteen years after
Fairy first was brought to Lewes, he announced
to his family that he had been
elected captain of the Lewes shearing
company, his face certainly glowed
with an honest pride, for he had then
obtained the highest honour which could
be conferred on a shepherd, and realised
his fondest dreams of earthly happiness.</p>

<p>In those days it was the custom for
shearers to form themselves into companies,
called after the district in which
they lived, and to go round to the
various farms in the district in the shearing
season, which begins in the middle
of June, shearing the different flocks.
The shearers in those days were
generally shepherds, and each band had
a lieutenant and a captain, the former
distinguished by a silver band round his
cap and a badge, the latter by a gold
band and badge to match. They were
chosen according to their proficiency in
shearing, and for the good character
they bore. John Shelley had been a
lieutenant for some years, but he was
now elected captain, owing to the death
of the captain of the Lewes band, an old
man over seventy; and with this honour
some new duties devolved upon him, for
at the captain’s house was held the
shearing feast, called the White Ram.
This feast lasted throughout the shearing
week, and consisted of a supper
after the day’s work was over; first, a
good, substantial meal, in which the
Sussex dish of beefsteak pudding, the
crust made of flour and water, played an
important part, and then ending with
cakes and ale, during the consumption
of which shearing songs were sung and
many pipes were smoked till late in the
long summer evening, when the men
dispersed—sometimes not before midnight—to
their various homes.</p>

<p>These bands are now a thing of the
past, though the shearing is still done by
men who go round for the purpose, but
no lambs are shorn nowadays, so the
work is very much lessened.</p>

<p>“There is plenty of work for you,
Polly; you’ll have to get someone in to
help you; we shall have to have the
White Ram here for the future,” said
John.</p>

<p>“Oh, what fun!” exclaimed Fairy;
“now I shall see it all, and hear the
shearing songs. Mother, you must let
me help; John says no one can make
plum heavies, not even you, mother, like
me: can they, John?”</p>

<p>“No, but I am thinking those little
white fingers of yours are not fit for that
sort of work, my pretty one,” said John.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">{180}</span></p>

<p>“Stuff! white fingers can work as well
as red ones—better, I daresay, if the
truth were known. And may I help to
wait on you?” asked Fairy.</p>

<p>“No, certainly not,” growled Jack;
“you listen outside to the shearing
songs with me, but you are not going
inside to wait on a lot of rough men,
who will, perhaps, take more beer than
they ought.”</p>

<p>“No, Jack; I’ll have none of that; it
shall never be said that John Shelley’s
White Ram is disgraced by drunkenness.
But you must come to the feast,
even if Fairy does not, for you must go
round shearing this year; it is time you
began, if, as I hope, one of these days
you are to take my place of captain.”</p>

<p>“There’s an honour for you, Captain
Jack. Don’t you wish you may ever get
it?” laughed Fairy.</p>

<p>But Jack neither laughed nor wished
for the honour; hitherto he had always
managed to escape going round with
the shearers, but this year he saw he
must go, since he had not the heart to
throw a shadow over his father’s innocent
joy by refusing; so he said with
the best grace he could, “Very well,
father, I’ll go shearing, but Fairy can’t
be left out in the cold, I shall have to
stay with her during the supper.”</p>

<p>“No, you need not, we will take it
by turns; I can stop with Fairy sometimes,”
said Charlie, a remark by no
means calculated to soothe Jack, whose
love and jealousy had grown greatly in
the last few years; but Mrs. Shelley
wisely stopped the discussion by remarking
that there was plenty of time to
settle the details, as the sheep-washing
was not begun yet.</p>

<p>“It begins to-morrow though; Jack
and I are off with half our flock at daybreak
to-morrow. Charlie, you must
follow the rest for a day or two; I must
have Jack with me to-morrow,” said the
shepherd.</p>

<p>“And I shall come too. If mother
can’t take me, I shall get the Leslies to
come. I always go to see our sheep
washed every year,” said Fairy.</p>

<p>Accordingly, early next morning the
shepherd and his son were up at dawn,
driving their sheep to the brook in which
the sheep-washing took place. For
some days previously, preparations had
been made for this washing, which lasts
two or three weeks, as all the sheep for
miles round are brought to this spot.
These preparations consisted of pens
made of hurdles by the side of the river
for the sheep; in the stream itself, opposite
to each other, were erected two
rough pulpits or deal boxes, in which
stand the sheep-washers. When Jack
and his father arrived, it was so early
that no one was there, not even the
washers; but at ten o’clock, when Mrs.
Shelley and Fairy went, the scene was a
most lively one.</p>

<p>Hundreds of sheep were in the pens,
some white and clean, their agonies
over; others still dirty, with their tortures
to come. On the neighbouring bridge
stood or leant every child in the village,
thoroughly enjoying the sight. On the
roadside were some stragglers of all
grades, watching the performance, one
or two farmers on horseback who had a
lively interest in the washing of their
flocks, and on the banks several shepherds,
among them Jack and his father,
all armed with large, toothless wooden
rakes, with which they push the sheep
about, holding them under water when
necessary, and steering them from
pulpit to pulpit.</p>

<p>What with the laughter and screams
of delight from the children, the shouts
of the shepherds, and the coughing of
the sheep and jingling of their bells, the
scene is a very noisy one; but, noisy as
it is, Fairy thoroughly enjoys it, and
declares she must stay till the last of
John’s red-ringed flock are finished. It
is such fun to see the poor sheep tumbled
into the water and then rolled over on
its back and rubbed from head to foot
in the bright, clear stream, first by one
washer in his pulpit, and then, after
sundry pushes and thumps from the
toothless rakes, to be seized by the other
washer and subjected to another
vigorous rubbing and scrubbing, and
splashing and dashing, and finally to be
pushed off to scramble or swim as best
it might out of the river.</p>

<p>Poor, patient sheep! They take their
sufferings in very good part, and submit
meekly enough to the inevitable
ordeal, basing a protest as feeble as it is
useless, the older and wiser ones knowing
that this washing is but a preliminary
to the still more disagreeable
ceremony of shearing to be performed a
fortnight hence, as soon as the wool is
dry. And Fairy, fascinated by the
picturesque scene, could not be persuaded
to move when Mrs. Shelley was
forced to go home to prepare some
dinner—a useless labour, Fairy declared,
since there would be no one to eat it,
for Charlie had taken his with him, and
John and Jack were too busy to stop
for dinner, and she herself was not
hungry, and had no intention of going
home till all John’s sheep were washed.
But Mrs. Shelley had no idea of leaving
a pretty young girl like Fairy alone
among a crowd of people, so she proposed
they should both go home and
fetch some dinner and share it out in
the field with John and Jack, a proposal
Fairy jumped at; and an hour later the
four were sitting on a bank under a
hedge of blackthorn, with a carpet of
buttercups and daisies at their feet,
eating their simple meal as happy as it
was possible for four people to be.</p>

<p>And then, while the shepherd smoked
his pipe, Jack gave Fairy a lesson in
the notes of the different birds which
were singing around them, and Mrs.
Shelley listened with pride to her eldest
and darling son, and wondered whether
Fairy would ever care for him in the way
he evidently cared for her, and thought
what a handsome couple they would
make.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack, how clever you are; you
know everything; but there, I do know
one thing—I am right this time at least—there
is a skylark singing up over our
heads. Look,” cried Fairy, who had been
making various wrong guesses at the
names of the different songsters around
them.</p>

<p>“Poor little Fairy! you are wrong
again; it is a woodlark; the skylark
mounts up straight in a succession of
springs, and then hovers, singing; the
woodlark flies round and round in
circles, singing all the while, as this
bird is doing,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh, I give it up; I know nothing;
but as long as I have you to tell me,
what does it matter? I shall go and
look for a wheatear’s nest in that fence,”
said Fairy, rising and shaking back her
long golden hair, which she still wore
down her back, and which added
greatly to her childish appearance.</p>

<p>“My pretty one, wheatears don’t
build in fences,” cried John Shelley, as
she ran lightly past him.</p>

<p>“She is doing it on purpose; she
knows as well as you and I wheatears
build in rabbit-holes or chalk-pits; she
only wants me to scold her,” said
Jack.</p>

<p>“It is time we were at work again,
Jack, or we shan’t get our eight
hundred washed to-day,” said John,
who saw Jack showed signs of going
after Fairy, and wisely thought he
would not see him back in a hurry if he
once let him go.</p>

<p>So the sheep-washing began again,
and Mrs. Shelley, who had brought some
work with her, promised Fairy to remain
till tea-time, on condition that she then
accompanied her home.</p>

<p>“I do enjoy it so, mother,” said
Fairy; “it would be wicked to spend
such a bright warm sunny day as this
shut up in a house; it is so delicious out
in this field. I wonder how much they
pay those washers; it must be dreadfully
hard work; they ought to pay them
well.”</p>

<p>“They give them half-a-crown for
every hundred sheep, and they can
wash a thousand sheep a day, but these
men won’t do more than finish John’s
eight hundred to-day.”</p>

<p>“That leaves nearly eight hundred
more for to-morrow. Oh! do let us
come and have another day like this.
Will you, mother?” pleaded Fairy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Shelley looked at the fair little
face, with its great brown eyes, its dainty
pink and white complexion, and the
long wavy hair which veiled the slight
girlish figure, and smiled and sighed—the
smile was for Fairy, and the sigh for
Jack—as she promised to do so if the
weather were fine.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p class="center">THE SHEEP-WASHING.</p></div>
</div>

<p>And so it came to pass that that sheep-washing
was long remembered by Jack
as two of the happiest days in his life,
though, alas! they came to an end, as all
days, however happy, must only too soon;
and then came a fortnight of preparation
for the great event of the shepherds’
year—the sheep-shearing and the Feast
of the White Ram. Jack had not much
to do with the preparations, for he was
upon the downs with his washed flock,
but little else was talked of when he came
home in the evening, and it was a very
busy time for Mrs. Shelley, who had to
provide supper for twelve men for five
nights, the shearing beginning on the
Tuesday, and ending on the Saturday,
when the money earned was divided
among the company. It had been a
source of much anxiety to Mrs. Shelley
to know where the supper was to be held.
To have these twelve men in the kitchen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">{181}</span>
in which she had to cook it all would be
very inconvenient, and she was by no
means inclined to lend the little sitting-room,
which Fairy had made so pretty,
for the purpose; but at last Jack suggested
borrowing a tent and pitching
it in the field near the house,
a plan which was at once
adopted. The shearing itself
took place outside
a barn belonging to
the farmer who owned
the sheep about to be
shorn, and the company
went round to the principal
farmers in the
neighbourhood, taking
one each day of the
shearing week. How
Jack hated this business of shearing!
He would have given anything
to have got out of it, if he
could only have done so without
vexing his father; but as this was
impossible, he was obliged to go
on with it with the best
grace he could, but he was
in an irritable mood all the
week. The work brought
him into contact with other
shepherds, with none of
whom had he anything in
common, and made him
realise his lowly position,
which in his lonely life on
the downs, lost in
his studies, he was
apt to forget. He
would long ago have
given up his shepherd’s calling
and gone to London to seek more
congenial work, if it had not been
for Fairy; she was the magnet
which held him in her vicinity, but
he was daily becoming aware
that if any of his dreams were to
be realised, he must go away at
once, though the time he spent on
the downs was by no means
wasted, since he was educating
himself to the best of his ability.
His idea was to try and
get an appointment as
usher in a school, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">{182}</span>
which in those days he was fully qualified.
In teaching others he would learn
himself; he would have access to books
of all kinds, and he would be able in his
leisure hours to pursue his favourite study
of natural history. He had confided
this plan to Mr. Leslie, who had promised
to look out for him, and when an
opening occurred to give him a testimonial.
Another reason which had kept
Jack at home hitherto was that Charlie
was barely old enough to take his place,
but during this last sheep-washing
Charlie had had the care of half the flock,
and had shown himself quite up to his
work, which, in the summer, at any rate,
was just the lazy, dreamy kind of life to
suit an indolent nature like his, and
Jack saw he need no longer delay his
departure because there was no one to
take his place. On the contrary, it
would solve a difficulty, for it had hitherto
been rather a puzzle to know what to
do with Charlie since John Shelley only
required one under-shepherd, and he did
not seem to have any inclination for any
other kind of work. Accordingly, all
through the White Ram Jack was
making up his mind to tear himself
away from Fairy, in the hope of eventually
winning for himself a position he
could ask her to share, and the thought
of the coming separation did not tend to
make him happier.</p>

<p>Every morning he started with the
rest of the Lewes company of shearers,
with his father at their head, for some
farm, where they spent their day in
shearing the sheep, pausing about
twelve and again about two o’clock to
“light up,” that is to sharpen their
shears, eat cakes, and drink beer, the
meal of the day being supper when they
got back after their labours were over.</p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">By</span> JAMES MASON.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Part III.</span></h3>

<div class="ddropcapbox illowe10_9375" id="i_p_182">
  <img class="w100 idropcap" src="images/i_p_182.jpg" alt="W" />
</div><p><span class="uppercase">e</span> are going now to
speak about money:
not, however, about
how to get it, but
about what to do
with it after it is
got. About the
occupations by
which money is
made, we shall not
at present say anything.
Many of them have already been
treated of in <span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own Paper</span>.</p>

<p>When people have money there are three
things they can do with it; they can spend it,
or place it out at interest, or tie it up in a
parcel and hide it away. Perhaps they do not
need at the moment to spend it; in that case
of the two ways that are left the only wise one
is to place it out at interest.</p>

<p>And what is <i>interest</i>? Interest is the sum
paid by anyone who gets the loan of money,
for the use of it. Selina, say, gets the loan of
£50 for a year—not for nothing—oh, no, she
pays £2 for the twelve months. This £2 is the
interest. At the end of the year the lender
receives back her £50 and £2 added to it, so,
you see, it is for a good reason that we recommend
lending in preference to unfruitful
hoarding. Money—and this is a wise rule—should
never be allowed to lie idle.</p>

<p>The sum lent is known as the <i>principal</i>,
and on the principal the interest is calculated
at so much <i>per cent.</i> (by the hundred); that is
to say, at so much for every £100. For
instance, 5 per cent. means £5 for the use of
every £100; 2½ per cent., £2 10s. for the use
of every £100; and 3¾ per cent., £3 15s. for
the use of every £100. Selina’s loan, in the
preceding paragraph, is at 4 per cent., in other
words, £4 for £100; so, of course, for £50 she
just pays £2.</p>

<p>When you see a rate of interest quoted
you may safely conclude that it is for a year—<i>per
annum</i> (by the year), is the correct phrase—unless
something is said to the contrary.</p>

<p>The rate paid in the shape of interest
depends on a number of things, but the main
question is, will the principal be perfectly safe?
If the answer be yes, then the interest in these
days will certainly be low. But on this subject
we shall have more to say in a succeeding
article.</p>

<p>To calculate interest on any sum <i>for a year</i>,
the rule is to multiply by the rate per cent.
and divide by 100. For example, find the
interest on £460 at 4½ per cent. Here you
multiply 460 by 4½, which gives 2,070, and
dividing by 100, arrive at the answer,
£20 14s.</p>

<p>When the interest is wanted <i>for a certain
number of days</i>, you must multiply by the
number of days and by double the rate per
cent., and divide by 73,000. By way of
example, find the interest on £320 for 30 days
at 3 per cent. Multiply 320, first by 30 and
afterwards by 6, which gives 57,600. Now
divide by 73,000, and you have the total
amount of interest, 15s. 9d.</p>

<p>People who have much calculating of interest
to do should invest in a book of Commercial
Tables. The use of these saves a great deal
of trouble. There are some short cuts, however,
which every business woman should
carry in her head. At 5 per cent. per annum
the interest upon a pound for every month is
one penny. Having seen what this comes to,
other rates may be reckoned by adding to or
deducting from the 5 per cent. product.</p>

<p>For example, 2½ per cent. is one-half; 3 per
cent. is six-tenths; 3½ per cent. is seven-tenths;
4 per cent. is four-fifths; 6 per cent. is six-fifths;
7½ per cent. is one-half more. Thus,
5 per cent. on £30 for ten months will be
£1 5s.; 2½ per cent., 12s. 6d.; 3 per cent.,
15s.; 3½ per cent., 17s. 6d.; 4 per cent., £1;
6 per cent., £1 10s.; and 7½ per cent.,
£1 17s. 6d.</p>

<p>Sometimes, on interest becoming due, it is
regularly added to the principal, and interest
is paid on the new principal thus formed.
Money invested on this accumulating system
is said to be placed at <i>compound interest</i>.</p>

<p>There is something startling about the
growth of money invested in this way. “A
penny,” says Dr. Price, “so improved from
our Saviour’s birth as to double itself every
fourteen years—or, what is nearly the same,
put out at five per cent. compound interest at
our Saviour’s birth—would by this time have
increased to more money than could be contained
in 150 millions of globes, each equal
to the earth in magnitude, and all solid
gold.</p>

<p>“A shilling put out at six per cent. compound
interest would, in the same time, have
increased to a greater sum in gold than the
whole solar system could contain, supposing
it a sphere equal in diameter to the diameter
of Saturn’s orbit; and the earth is to such
a sphere as half a square foot or a quarto page
is to the whole surface of the earth.”</p>

<p>To show the difference between “simple
interest,” in which the interest does not bear
interest, and “compound interest,” in which
it does, we give the following table, showing
the time it takes for a sum to double itself at
different rates:—</p>

<p>The really surprising difference between
simple and compound interest is, however,
only seen after the first few years are over.
A loan of £100 for ten years at 4 per cent.
simple interest would give £40, and at 4 per cent.
compound interest about £47. But if
the loan were for a hundred years the simple
interest would be only £400, whilst the compound
interest would be no less than £4,950.</p>

<p>Having now said all that is necessary at
present about interest, we must speak for a
little on the subject of banking, for it is by
means of banks that most money transactions
are satisfactorily managed.</p>

<p>What, then, is a bank? There seems, at
first sight, something mysterious about it, but
it is really a simple institution. It is partly a
shop and partly a left-luggage office. It is a
shop for dealing in cheques, bills, notes, gold,
and silver, and a left-luggage office to which
we consign our spare cash to lie till called for.</p>

<p>This, however, is only a rough and ready
way of putting it, and we may as well add the
following extract from a writer who has taken
pains to give an exact definition:—“A banker
is the custodier of the money of other people.
Such is his business, viewed in its simplest
aspect. A banker, however, if he hoarded the
money deposited with him, would be simply a
cash-keeper to the public; his bank would be
literally a bank of <i>deposit</i>.... But the
business of receiving money on deposit has
always been, and is now, universally combined
with that of lending it out. A banker does
not hoard all the money deposited with him—he
gives the greater portion out in loan. The
lending of money is as much a part of his
business as the receiving of deposits.”</p>

<p>You cannot go into a banker’s and say, “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">{183}</span>
have come to open an account,” just as you
would enter a grocer’s with, “Be so good as
send me half a dozen tins of the best sardines.”
You must be introduced by someone
who can vouch for your respectability, or, if
not introduced, you must be able yourself to
satisfy the banker that you are likely to be a
desirable customer.</p>

<p>This first step being taken, you open what
is called a <i>current or drawing account</i>; that
is to say, an account into which you can pay
money whenever it suits you, and from which
you can draw money at any time by means of
orders, or <i>cheques</i>, as they are called. In a
current account in a good bank money is
kept safely—which is a great matter—and at
the same time you can make use of it as readily
as if it were lying in your pocket.</p>

<p>For convenience, and partly, too, as a protection
against fraud, bankers are in the habit
of supplying their customers with books containing
forms of cheques. When a book of
cheques is exhausted, a new one is supplied on
the presentation of a form which, when filled
up, may resemble the following:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="smcap">The Cashier</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap ml2">The Cosmopolitan Bank.</span><br />
<span class="ml4"><span class="smcap">London</span>, <i>29th November, 1886.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p><i>Please deliver to Bearer Cheque Book containing
25 cheques payable to</i><br />
<span class="smcap ml8">Jemima Bouncer.</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Each cheque bears a penny impressed
stamp, and a book of cheques is supplied at
the price of the stamps—a book, say, of
twenty-five costing two shillings and a penny.</p>

<p>Cheques may be in one or other of two
forms. The first form is—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
No. 478953.      <span class="smcap">London</span>............188...<br />
<span class="ml2"><span class="smcap">The Cosmopolitan Bank</span>,</span><br />
<span class="ml4">14, Marketjew-street, E.C.</span><br />
<br />
Pay..................or Bearer..................<br />
£...............
</p></div>

<p>The other form is precisely the same, except
that instead of the word “Bearer” it has
the word “Order.”</p>

<p>As an example of a cheque with the particulars
filled in, take the following:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>No. 536212.</p>

<p>
<span class="ml4"><span class="smcap">London</span>, 19th November, 1886.<br /></span>
<span class="smcap ml2">The Cosmopolitan Bank,</span><br />
<span class="ml6">14, Marketjew-street, E.C.</span><br />
</p>

<p><i>Pay Miss Georgina Makepeace or Bearer
Nine pounds Thirteen shillings and Four
pence.</i></p>

<p>
£9: 13: 4.
<span class="ml8">Alice M. Littleproud.</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>The difference between cheques made out
to “Bearer” and those made out to “Order”
is this. Cheques payable to bearer can be
cashed by anyone. Those payable to order,
however, must be endorsed by the person in
whose favour they are drawn before the money
can be received. But what is to <i>endorse</i> a
cheque? It is simply to write your name
on the back of it.</p>

<p>Cheques payable to order are certainly safer
than those payable to bearer. And they have
another advantage. In the event of receipts
being lost or mislaid, they supply evidence that
the money was received by the person to
whom it was owing.</p>

<p>A cheque payable to bearer can be made
payable to order by drawing the pen through
“Bearer,” and writing “Order” above it.
A cheque payable to order can also be made
payable to bearer by scratching out “Order”
and putting “Bearer” above it; but in this
case you must put your initials to the alteration.</p>

<p>To give extra security to a cheque, draw two
parallel lines across the face of it with the
words “—— &amp; Co.” inserted between them.
This makes it what is called a “crossed
cheque,” which will only be paid through
some banker to a known customer. Instead
of “—— &amp; Co.” you may write the name
of the banker of the person to whom the
cheque is payable. When this is done, the
cheque is only payable through him.</p>

<p>If in crossing the cheque you add the
words “Not negociable,” that is another safeguard.
These words “warn all whom it may
concern that they accept the cheque subject
to the liability of being compelled to refund
its value should it prove to have come improperly
into the possession of any person from
whom their own title is derived.” This makes
a cheque as secure against the wiles of the
dishonest as anything in this world can be.</p>

<p>The filling up of a cheque should be done
very carefully, and the style of signature
should be always the same. The figures in the
body of a cheque must be in words, and should
be written close together, so that there is no
room left for the fraudulent to improve on
the amount. Cases have frequently occurred
of “ty” being added to six, seven, and nine,
to make them read sixty, seventy, and ninety,
and a “y” being given as a tail to eight, to
multiply eight by ten, is quite a common trick.
As a protection, the words “Under ten
pounds” are sometimes written upon a cheque
that lends itself to this sort of roguery.</p>

<p>Suppose a cheque is given by a person who
has not money enough in the bank to meet it,
the banker will most likely return it, with the
words written on it, “No effects,” or “Refer
to Drawer.” The cheque is then said to be
<i>dishonoured</i>.</p>

<p>Cheques should always be <i>cashed</i>—that is
to say, payment of them should be got—as soon
as possible after they have come to hand. It
is never safe to delay, for the most unlikely
things happen; the bank may fail, or the
drawer may become bankrupt, or his account
may become locked up through his death.</p>

<p>A memorandum should be preserved of
every cheque you give away. This is provided
for by the cheque-books furnished by the
banks having a margin which is left when the
cheque is torn out. This margin, separated
from the cheque by a perforated line, is known
as the <i>counterfoil</i>. The counterfoil bears the
same number as the cheque to which it is
attached. Here is an example of one filled up:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
No. 213,551<br />
<span class="ml2"><i>17th November, 1886.</i></span><br />
<span class="ml2"><span class="smcap">Dr. Simon Burre.</span></span><br />
<span class="ml2"><i>Medical Attendance.</i></span><br />
£7.7.0
</p></div>

<p>On the back of each counterfoil some people
are in the habit of writing the balance they
have at the moment in the bank. This has
some advantages, and is certainly a check to
extravagance.</p>

<p>Though cheques are usually made out on
engraved forms, you may write a cheque on a
sheet of note-paper should a cheque-book not
be at hand. In that case, remember to put a
penny stamp on it, and to cancel the stamp by
writing on it the date and your initials.</p>

<p>Keep your cheque-book always under lock
and key. If you leave it about, it only puts
temptation in the way of people to abstract a
blank form and make free with your signature.
Should your book ever be lost or stolen, give
notice at once to the bank.</p>

<p>Lodging money is one of the easiest of
business operations. You go to the bank, and
fill up a slip, headed, say—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="smcap ml4">The Cosmopolitan Bank,</span><br />
<span class="ml6">14, Marketjew-street.</span><br />
<span class="ml8">............18...</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Credit</span>...........................<br />
<i>Paid in by</i>.....................
</p></div>

<p>Below this heading you enter the particulars
of the sum you are going to lodge:—Bank-notes,
so much; coin, so much; cheques and
bills (mentioned separately), so much; total,
so much. You hand this slip over to the
teller with the money, and the whole thing is
done. No receipt is given, and it says a great
deal for the perfect machinery by which banking
is conducted that one never hears of a
mistake, or that any customer ever thought
his confidence taken advantage of. We speak
here of the method in the best London banks.
In the provinces and in some London establishments
the form of procedure varies a little.</p>

<p>When you send money to your banker by
post, you should write with it somewhat as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><i>Brackenhurst, 24th November, 1886.</i></p>

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>,</p>

<p><i>I enclose cheque for £34 12/—Messrs.
Bagwell and Sackit on the Welsh Counties
Bank—which kindly place to my credit.</i></p>

<p>
<span class="ml2"><i>I remain, Dear Sir</i>,</span><br />
<span class="ml6"><i>Yours truly</i>,</span><br />
<span class="smcap ml4">Silvaninha Hamilton.</span><br />
<br />
<i>The Manager</i>,<br />
<span class="smcap ml2">The Cosmopolitan Bank.</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Receipt of this will be acknowledged by the
manager, thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Dear Madam</i>,</p>

<p><i>I beg to acknowledge receipt of your
favour of 24th inst., with enclosure, value
£34 12/, for your credit.</i></p>

<p>
<span class="ml8"><i>Yours, etc.,</i></span><br />
<span class="smcap ml4">Jacob Birchenough,</span><br />
<span class="ml8"><i>Manager.</i></span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>To every person keeping an account the
bank supplies a book, generally known as a
<i>pass-book</i>. On the Dr. or left-hand side of
this book, will appear the sums received on
behalf of the owner of the book; whilst all
the cheques paid on her account by the bank
will appear on the Cr. or right-hand side.
Here is an example in which, for convenience,
we have printed the Cr. side under the Dr.,
instead of side by side:</p>

<p>In this book you must never make an entry
yourself. It should be left at regular intervals
at the bank to be “made-up,” that is to say,
for all the sums received and paid to be entered
in it. The pass-book is really a copy of the
bank ledger. When received again from the
bank it should be gone over carefully to see
that all the entries are just as they should be.</p>

<p>Current accounts, as a general rule in
England, do not bear any interest, in other
words, the banker pays nothing for the use
he enjoys of any balance left in his hands.
Unless the balance is large he thinks he does
enough in taking the trouble of keeping the
account. In Scotland interest is usually given
on current accounts, but it is only a slight
advance upon nothing.</p>

<p>Besides receiving money on current account,
however, bankers receive it on <i>deposit</i>. <i>Deposit
accounts</i> are those in which sums of
money are lodged in a bank on the understanding
that a certain rate of interest is to be
paid upon them, and that a certain number of
days’ notice is to be given before they are
withdrawn. There is no such thing as
drawing cheques on a deposit account.</p>

<p>When money is received on deposit, a
deposit receipt is given. The amount is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">{184}</span>
usually repayable to the depositor alone, but it
may also be paid to anyone to whom the
depositor gives an order on the bank, either
written on the back of the deposit receipt or
accompanying it.</p>

<p>The rate of interest paid on deposits varies
with the Bank of England rate. It is, however,
usually so small that no one, except for
special reasons, will let money lie on deposit
in a bank whilst there are plenty of perfectly
safe investments to be met with outside.</p>

<p>For business women who travel few business
documents are of greater interest than a <i>letter
of credit</i>. This is a communication from a
banker to a correspondent, or correspondents,
authorising credit to be given to the bearer to
a certain specified amount.</p>

<p>In applying for a letter of credit you must
name to your banker the sum you will require
altogether, and the number of towns in which
you wish to draw portions of that sum, and if
there are, say, three towns—Paris, Berlin and
Rome—you must enclose your signature on
three separate sheets of paper. The banker
sends one of these slips to an agent in each of
the towns named, and forwards to you a letter
of credit in this form:—</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>,</p>

<p><i>We have the pleasure of establishing
a credit in favour of Miss Robina Turpin,
who will present to you this letter, and we
shall thank you to supply her with cash
to the amount of one hundred and twenty-five
pounds (£125) sterling, or such part
thereof as may not previously have been paid
on this credit, writing off on the back of this
letter the sum advanced, and taking her drafts
on us in your favour for your reimbursement,
which we engage duly to honour.</i></p>

<p>
<span class="ml2"><i>We remain, Gentlemen,</i></span><br />
<span class="ml4"><i>Your most obedient Servants,</i></span><br />
<span class="smcap ml6">Smith, Paterson &amp; Winkles.</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Across the face of the letter of credit is
written, “<i>This credit to be in force for twelve
months only from this date.</i>”</p>

<p><i>Circular Notes</i>, as they are called, are in
one respect an improvement on a letter of
credit: they can be cashed in almost every
town the traveller is likely to visit. They are
issued by most London bankers and for sums of
from £10 upwards.</p>

<p>A banker has a pretty responsible time of it.
He is bound to keep secret the state of his
customer’s account. He must also know his
customer’s handwriting, so, should he pay a
cheque or bill which turns out to be a forgery,
he must bear the loss. If he neglects to carry
out any instructions within the legitimate
sphere of banking business, such as the payment
of premiums on a life insurance or the
purchase of shares, he may be called to account
for any loss the customer may suffer through
his carelessness.</p>

<p>The simplest bank in the country, and the
most important to depositors of small means
is the Post Office Savings Bank, about which
we must now speak. It is an extensive institution,
having over eight thousand branch
establishments all over the country; indeed,
every money order office is a branch office of
the Post Office Savings Bank. At the present
time there are more than three and a half
millions of accounts open, with an average
balance of £13 10s., and the average turnover
of the bank, counting both the money deposited
and the money drawn out, is twenty-eight
million pounds a year.</p>

<p>You cannot, in the Post Office Savings
Bank, open an account from which, by means
of cheques, you can draw money at any hour.
It does not provide cheque books, and makes
the withdrawal of money comparatively a slow
process, for its leading idea is not to facilitate
present business, but to provide for future
need. It really starts with the reflection that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If youth but knew what age would crave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Many a penny it would save.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>An account may be opened with a very
small sum. You can do it with a shilling.
With that in your hand you can go to a post
office, and assert your intention of placing
your savings under the care of the Government.
And remember that the shilling, and
anything else added to it, will be safer than in
any other bank whatever; for the Post Office
Savings Bank can only come to grief with the
ruin of the British Empire.</p>

<p>Intending depositors must state their Christian
name and surname, occupation (if any),
and residence, and they must sign a declaration
to the effect that they have no interest in
any savings bank account, and are willing to
have any deposits they may make managed
according to the regulations of the Post
Office.</p>

<p>When that is done a deposit book is supplied.
In this book every deposit must be
entered at the time of its being made by the
postmaster, or whoever receives it, and he
must affix to the entry his signature and the
stamp of the office.</p>

<p>“In addition to the receipt in the book,
the depositor will receive an acknowledgment
by post from the Savings Bank department
in London, and this should reach him
within four clear days, exclusive of Sundays
and bank holidays, if the deposit be made in
England or Wales; within six days, if it be
made in Ireland or Scotland.”</p>

<p>The interest allowed is 2½ per cent. per
annum—that is to say, at the rate of £2 10s.
every year for every £100. This is just a halfpenny
each month for every pound. Thus, a
pound lodged in the bank, and lying there for
a year, becomes £1 0s. 6d.: £10 becomes
£10 5s.; and £30 grows to be £30 15s. The
interest is calculated to the 31st of December
in every year, and is then added to and becomes
part of the principal.</p>

<p>The deposits made in any year ending 31st
December must not exceed £30, and when a
depositor has lodged in all £150, not counting
interest, she is not allowed to lodge any more
till she has reduced the sum standing at her
credit. If she chooses to let it lie, it will, of
course, by the addition of interest, increase
every year. When it reaches £200, however,
no more interest is allowed till some of the
money is withdrawn.</p>

<p>When a depositor wishes to withdraw any
money, she fills up a notice of withdrawal, to
be had at any Post Office Savings Bank, and
forwards it to the Savings Bank Department
in London. She then receives by post a warrant,
which she should present with her book
at the post office where payment is to be
made.</p>

<p>Once in every year, on the anniversary of
the day on which the first deposit was made,
the deposit book should be forwarded to the
Controller of the Savings Bank Department
in London, that the entries may be checked,
and that the sum due for interest may be
added. When sending the book, do not pay
postage: all communications on Savings Bank
business go free.</p>

<p>Deposits may be made by married women,
and in that case their husbands have no control
over the money. They can draw from it
when they please, and bequeath it by will
to any person they choose.</p>

<p>The Post Office Savings Bank adapts itself
to saving on the smallest scale. If a girl can
only save a penny at a time, she can with
the penny buy a stamp, and the stamp she can
stick on a form with twelve divisions, supplied
by the Post Office. When she has in this
way saved twelve stamps, she must take it to
the post office, and have the shilling entered
in a regular bank account.</p>

<p>But the Post Office undertakes more business
in connection with money than merely
storing it up against a rainy day. Of that,
however, we shall speak in our next article.</p>

by an early
train, and arrived
at
Netherton
soon after
four. I knew
we were to be
met at the
station, and
was not at
all surprised
when a fresh-coloured,
white-haired
old gentleman
brandished his stick as a token of
welcome to Joyce. I was quite sure that
it was Squire Cheriton before Joyce
clapped her hands and exclaimed,
“There’s gran.”</p>

<p>“Halloa, little one,” he said, cheerily,
as she ran up to him with a joyous face,
“so you have not forgotten grandfather.
Bless me, you are not a bit like Vi, you
have taken after Alick. So this is the
boy, nurse? Dear me! which is the
nurse?” looking at me with rather a
puzzled countenance.</p>

<p>“I am the nurse, sir,” I returned,
quietly; “and this is Hannah.”</p>

<p>“Hannah Sowerby, of course. Bless
me, I never forget a face—never; I
knew yours directly,” as Hannah
dropped a countrified curtsey to the
squire. “I saw Michael the other day;
he was looking hale and hearty—hale
and hearty; ‘that comes of hard work
and temperate living, Michael,’ I said—oh,
we are both of an age, old Michael
and I, and I am hale and hearty, too.
So this is my grandson; he is a fine
fellow; takes after Vi, I should say.
Come along, come along, there’s auntie
waiting for us,” and, talking half to us
and half to himself, Mr. Cheriton led us
through the station. On the way, however,
we were stopped twice; first, the
station master was interviewed and the
children introduced to him—</p>

<p>“My grandchildren, Drake,” observed
the Squire, proudly, twirling his gold
headed stick as he spoke; then a burly
farmer jostled against the squire, and
the two commenced observations on the
weather.</p>

<p>“Fine weather for the crops, Roberts;
the oats look lively. These are my
grandchildren; fine boy that.”</p>

<p>“Little girl looks rather peaky, squire;
wants a bit of fattening.”</p>

<p>“Eh, what! We’ll fatten her, won’t
we, Joyce?” pinching the child’s thin
cheek. “Takes after her father, Alick
Morton. You can’t find fault with my
grandson, Roberts, I hope; never seen a
finer child in my life.”</p>

<p>“Father, father,” exclaimed a fresh
young voice, “what are you doing with
those children? Methuselah is fretting
terribly to be off. Do be quick, pray.”</p>

<p>“I am coming, Gay. Now then, all
of you, move on. Ta-ta, Roberts.” And
Mr. Cheriton drove us out before him.
An open barouche was waiting at the
door, and a young lady was on the box
trying to hold in a pair of thoroughbreds.
When she saw us, she at once handed
the reins to her father, and jumped
lightly to the ground.</p>

<p>“Kiss me, you darlings,” she said,
coaxingly; “don’t you know me yet?”
as Joyce hung back a little shyly. “I
am Gay, the little auntie, as you used to
call me. How do you do, Miss Fenton—you
see I know your name. Hannah, I
am glad to see you again. There is
plenty of room for us all; the boxes are
going by omnibus. Now, father, we
are all ready,” and in another moment
Methuselah and his mate were on their
homeward way.</p>

<p>Miss Cheriton chattered all the time.
She was a pretty, dark-eyed girl, rather
piquante in style, but not equal to her
beautiful sister, though I caught an
expression that reminded me now and
then of my mistress. She struck me as
very fresh and unconventional, and she
had a bright, chirpy voice and manner
that must have been very attractive to
children. Joyce made friends with her
at once, and even Reggie wanted to go
to her, and received her caresses and
compliments with unusual condescension.</p>

<p>“How wonderfully he has improved,
nurse—Miss Fenton, I mean. My sister
told me he was a lovely boy, and so he
is. Why, Rolf will look quite plain beside
him. What nicely-behaved children
they seem. Poor Rolf is such a plague
to us all.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you love Rolf, auntie?”
asked Joyce, fixing her dark eyes on
Miss Cheriton’s face.</p>

<p>The young aunt looked rather perplexed
at this question.</p>

<p>“When Rolf is good I love him, but
not when he teases, fidgets, or frightens
my canaries; I do not love him a bit
then. I am always longing to box his
ears, only his mother would be so angry
with me. Father, dear, do make Methuselah
go a little slower, Mr. Hawtry
is trying to overtake us.”</p>

<p>“Holloa, Roger,” exclaimed the
squire, in his hearty voice, “you did
not think to pass Methuselah, did you,
on that hack of yours?” And the next
moment a gentleman, well mounted on
a dark bay mare, rode up, and entered
into conversation with Miss Cheriton.
He threw a searching glance round the
carriage as he lifted his hat, and then
laid his hand on the carriage door.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, squire; Methuselah
seems a trifle fresh. How is it you are
not driving, as usual, Miss Cheriton?
Better employed, I suppose,” with a
look at Reggie. “So these are Alick
Morton’s children, are they? The little
girl looks delicate. You must bring
them out to my place; Mrs. Cornish will
give them plenty of new milk. By the
by, isn’t that Hannah Sowerby?” And
as she dimpled and looked pleased,
“Why, I was over at Wheeler’s Farm
this morning, and your sister Molly
was talking about you. I wanted Matthew
to come up to the Red Farm for a
job—he is a handy fellow, that brother
of yours—so, as I was waiting, I had a
chat with Molly.”</p>

<p>I looked across at Hannah and saw
how this kindly mention of her home
pleased her. It was good-natured of
Mr. Hawtry to single her out, and this
little act of Christian charity prepossessed
me in his favour. He was not
very young—a little over thirty, I should
have judged—and had a strong sensible
face, “not a mask without any meaning
to it,” as Aunt Agatha sometimes said,
but a face that seemed to reveal a
sensible, downright character.</p>

<p>I saw Mr. Hawtry look in my direction
once a little doubtfully. I daresay,
being an old friend of the family, he
thought it rather odd that Miss Cheriton
did not introduce him to me, but Joyce
soon enlightened him.</p>

<p>“Oh, nurse! do look at those pretty
flowers,” she called out, pulling my gown
to enforce my attention.</p>

<p>“Yes, I see them, dear,” I answered,
quietly, and then Reggie became restless
and struggled to get to me, so I
took him in my arms, and at that
moment the carriage turned in at some
lodge gates.</p>

<p>I had not been able to judge much
of the place. Miss Cheriton’s chatter
had engrossed me. I knew we had
driven very fast through a pretty village,
and that we had turned off down a country
road, and that was all. Once I
fancied I had caught a blue shimmer in
the distance that must have been the
sea, but after we had turned into the
lodge gates, I took no more notice of
Miss Cheriton and her companion. I
was far too curious to see Marshlands,
the home where my beloved mistress had
passed her childhood.</p>

<p>A short avenue brought us to the
gravelled sweep before the hall door. A
large sunny garden with terraces seemed
to stretch into a park-like meadow; in
reality it was divided by a wire fence to
keep in the sheep that were feeding between
the trees. An old white pony was
looking across the fence, attracted by
the sound of our horses, a little black and
tan terrier flew out on the steps barking,
and a peacock, who was spreading his
tail on the sundial, retreated in much
disgust, sweeping his train of feathers
behind him.</p>

<p>“Jacko hates Fidgets,” observed Miss
Cheriton, as the children clapped their
hands at the gorgeous bird, and then
Mr. Hawtry dismounted and lifted Joyce
out of the carriage.</p>

<p>I stood for a moment with Reggie in
my arms, admiring the old red brick
house, with its ivy-covered gables, before
we entered the wide dark hall, and it
was then that I distinctly heard Mr.
Hawtry say—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">{187}</span></p>

<p>“Who is that young lady?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean the children’s nurse,
Miss Fenton?” observed Miss Cheriton,
carelessly. “Oh, yes, Vi says she is
quite a lady, and very nice, but——”
Here I passed on quickly and lost the
rest, only my foolish cheeks caught fire.
Merle, Merle, be prudent, remember the
Valley of Humiliation. What does it
matter, my girl, what the world thinks?
Eve was a dairymaid in Eden.</p>

<p>An old grey-headed butler had hurried
out to meet us. Miss Cheriton, who
had joined us after a minute or two,
questioned him at once.</p>

<p>“Is Mrs. Markham still out, Benson?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am, and Master Rolf and
Judson are with her, but I have taken
tea into the morning-room.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Benson, I will be down
presently. Now, Miss Fenton, let me
show you your quarters,” and she preceded
us up the dark old staircase, and
down a long narrow lobby, lighted with
small lozenged pane windows, and threw
open a door at the end of the passage.
“This is the old day nursery, and there
are two bedrooms communicating with
it. Susan will bring up the children’s
tea directly. Will you ring for anything
you want. I am sorry I cannot wait
now, but I must pour out tea for my
father and Mr. Hawtry. I will come up
again by-and-by,” and she nodded
pleasantly and ran away.</p>

<p>I looked round the nursery approvingly.
It was such a charming, old-fashioned
room, rather low, perhaps, but with
brown wainscotting, and a dark panelled
ceiling, and wooden window seats, and
though the windows were small, they
were deliciously quaint, and they looked
out on the grass terrace and the sundial,
and there was the white pony grazing
under the elms, and such a pretty peep
of the park, as I supposed they called it.
An old black-faced sheep came in sight;
I called Joyce to look at it, and even
Reggie clapped his dear little hands,
and cried out, “Ba—ba, ba—ba.”</p>

<p>The bedrooms were just as cosy and
old-fashioned as the nursery. The bed
where Joyce and I were to sleep was
hung with curious blue chintz, and
there was an oak wardrobe that looked
black with age, and curious prints in
little black frames hung round the walls.
Reggie’s cot had chintz hangings too.
The afternoon sunshine was flooding
the room, as I stood at the window a
moment. I called to Hannah to admire
the view. We were at the back of the
house; there was a kitchen garden and
fruit trees, then came a deep, narrow lane
and cornfield, and beyond lay the sea;
I could even catch sight of a white sail
very near the shore.</p>

<p>I never saw Hannah so excited as she
was when she caught sight of that lane.
She thrust her head out of the window,
almost overbalancing herself in her
eagerness.</p>

<p>“Why, miss,” she exclaimed, “there
is Cherry-tree-lane, and if we could only
see round the corner—but those pear
trees shut it out—we should see
Wheeler’s Farm. Isn’t it like being
at home?” her voice trembling with
emotion. “Directly I had a taste of the
salt air, and a glimpse of Squire Hawtry’s
cornfields, I felt almost beside
myself.” And indeed the girl’s honest
joy was good to witness, and again,
as I thought of those sisters crowding
out the attics of Wheeler’s Farm, I
could have found it in my heart to envy
Hannah.</p>

<p>When I had taken off the children’s
things we went back to the day nursery.
A freckled-faced country girl was covering
the round table with all sorts of
dainties—new laid eggs, fruit, jam, and
honey; there seemed no end to the good
things. She nodded to Hannah in a
friendly way, and asked after her health
in broad Sussex dialect.</p>

<p>“Do you know Susan?” I observed,
in some surprise, as I poured out some
milk for the thirsty children.</p>

<p>“She is a neighbour’s daughter,”
replied Hannah, as she waited on us.
“Susan was never much to my taste,
but we learnt our samplers together. The
Mullinses are not our sort,” she continued,
with manifest pride. “Joseph
Mullins is the village cobbler, but he is
none too steady, and father and Molly
can’t abide him.”</p>

<p>As soon as the children had finished
their tea, I took them to the window,
where they found plenty to amuse them.
The white pony was still cropping the
grass; here and there was a nibbling
sheep; the rooks were cawing about their
nests in the elm trees; the peacock was
strutting along the terrace, accompanied
by his mate; a pair of golden-crested
pheasants followed them.</p>

<p>Presently the bay mare was brought
round by a groom, and Mr. Hawtry
came out on the terrace, and stood
talking to Mr. Cheriton before he
mounted.</p>

<p>“Why did you call him Squire Hawtry,
Hannah?” I observed, curiously,
as he rode away down the avenue.</p>

<p>“He is mostly called by that name,”
returned Hannah. “He is a gentleman
farmer, and lives at the Red Farm down
Dorlcote way. His mother and sister
used to live with him, but his mother
died two years ago, and Miss Agnes
did not long survive her. She was a
sweet creature, and very handsome, but
she had been a sad invalid the last few
years of her life.”</p>

<p>“Poor Mr. Hawtry! and he is all
alone.”</p>

<p>“Quite alone, except for his good old
housekeeper, Mrs. Cornish; she takes
good care of Mr. Roger, as she calls
him. Folks say,” continued Hannah,
somewhat hesitating, “Squire Hawtry
has had enough of loneliness and nursing
Miss Agnes, and that he is looking out
for a wife; he and Miss Gay are firm
friends, and——”</p>

<p>“I think Reggie is getting sleepy,”
I observed, hastily, for Joyce was listening
with all her might, and the old proverb
is true in saying “little pitchers
have long ears;” besides which this was
gossiping about other people’s affairs,
and Hannah knew I never countenanced
gossip; it always seemed to me such a
mean and undignified thing to chatter
about those who were inmates of the
house that sheltered us. We had partaken
of their bread and salt, and so
they ought to have been sacred to us.
How little the world understands the so-called
word “honour,” but “<i>Noblesse
oblige</i>” is a safe motto.</p>

<p>Hannah took the hint with her usual
good nature, and went off for the bath
water. The next moment there was a
slight peremptory tap at the nursery
door, and before I could answer a tall,
elegant-looking woman, dressed in black,
entered the room. I rose at once in
some little trepidation; of course it was
Mrs. Markham.</p>

<p>“Good evening, nurse,” she said, in
rather a thin, highly-pitched voice. “I
hope you find yourself comfortable, and
that the children are not tired with the
journey.” Then, without waiting for an
answer, she seated herself languidly, and
called to Joyce, “Come to me, my dear;
I am your Aunt Adelaide; good
children always come when they are
called.”</p>

<p>I gave Joyce a slight push, for she
was hanging back in a most unaccountable
way, and yet she was by no means
a shy child, and would be friendly even
with strangers, if she liked their appearance.
I thought Mrs. Markham looked
a little annoyed at her hesitation, but
she controlled herself and tried coaxing.</p>

<p>“What would your mamma say, if you
refused to kiss poor Aunt Adelaide?
Come, that is better,” as Joyce
advanced, timidly. “Why what a thin,
sickly-looking child it is,” regarding the
sweet little face before her rather critically;
“I should hardly have thought,”
speaking half to herself, “that Violet
would have had such a plain child.”</p>

<p>I was indignant at this; for everyone
thought Joyce had a lovely little face,
though it was rather too thin and grave.
“Excuse me, Mrs. Markham,” I observed,
hastily, “but Joyce is a very
forward child, and understands all that
is said before her,” for it was hard that
our pet should meet with such a cold
reception.</p>

<p>Mrs. Markham regarded me with
a supercilious stare; she evidently
thought I was taking a liberty with her
in venturing to remonstrate, but I took
no notice, and prudently restrained myself.</p>

<p>I felt, even at that first moment, an
unaccountable dislike to Mrs. Markham.
Most people would have pronounced her
very handsome, in spite of her sallow
complexion and thin lips, but a certain
hardness in her expression repelled me,
as it repelled Joyce. Her dark eyes
regarded one so coldly; there was such
hauteur and indifference in her manners;
and then the metallic harshness of her
voice! “How could she be Mrs. Morton’s
sister?” I thought, as I recalled the sweet
graciousness, the yielding softness, that
made my dear mistress so universally
beloved.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHRISTMAS_IN_THE_GERMAN_FATHERLAND">CHRISTMAS IN THE GERMAN FATHERLAND.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the days of my youth it was my good
fortune to have letters of introduction to some
German friends of our family, and to be invited
to spend the winter with them in their
charming country house at the foot of the
Riesengebirge.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>It was the 24th of December, and bitterly
cold, when I emerged from the railway carriage
upon the platform of a small country
station, and was taken into friendly possession
by a vivacious little dark-eyed baroness and
her tall, flaxen-haired son, who, with many
fears that I must be nearly frozen by my long
journey from Berlin, wrapped me in an extra
fur and supplied me with a third veil before
allowing me to encounter the keen outer air
and a long sledge drive.</p>

<p>To drive in a sledge at all was to me a novel
and delightful experience, and the sledge to
which I was now conducted was particularly
pretty, with its body of light carved wood, its
fur rugs lined with crimson, its pair of cream-coloured
Russian ponies, with their harness
studded with silver knobs, and arches of
silver bells over their heads; and when once
we were all warmly ensconced among the
cushions and wrappers, and were gliding with
noiseless swiftness over the well-kept sledge-way,
it seemed to me that sledging was the
very acme of luxurious motion, and I felt almost
sorry when Baron Max checked his
ponies to point out the high tower, now close
at hand, which he said formed part of the
main building of his home.</p>

<p>After passing through some fine pine-woods,
we drove across the whilom moat, now planted
with trees and called the Dark Walk, and,
driving under a small archway, found ourselves
in a spacious court laid out as a flower-garden,
while facing us, and forming three sides of a
hollow square, stood the schloss itself. The
great entrance was approached by a long flight
of steps, and upon these were several liveried
servants awaiting our arrival, while at the
sound of the sleigh-bells and the cracking of
the driver’s whip, two great wolfhounds rushed
out to welcome their master, and were followed,
more sedately, by the daughters of the
house, who from their striking disparity in
height were always known by the sobriquet
of Tiny and Tall.</p>

<p>To Tiny’s care I was immediately consigned,
and, after a brief adjournment to my room,
was led by her into the saloon, where we
found Tall presiding over the coffee and
cakes, which, as I discovered later on, she
had herself prepared.</p>

<p>The Baroness had disappeared, leaving an
apology for me that, as it was Christmas Eve,
she had much to do, to which she must
attend, and while we were waiting the signal
to go and view the tree, Tiny and Tall proceeded
to enlighten me as to many of their
national customs in connection with this
particular season.</p>

<p>In this village, for instance, as in many
others of the Fatherland, and especially in
Southern Germany, a veiled woman goes up
and down the streets after nightfall, bearing
in her arms a child chosen for his beauty and
goodness to represent the Infant Saviour, and
as they pass along they find the cottage windows
discreetly left ajar, so that the Christ-child,
as he is called, can leave upon the sill
some token of the day. Every good child,
upon awakening next morning, finds gifts—oranges,
sweeties, or some such things; but,
alas for the child who has been naughty! for
him are no such delights; for him there lies
only a pliant willow or birchen rod, suggestive
of the chastisement he deserves. Into the
towns the Christ-child seldom comes; he is
there replaced by the Christmas tree; and it
was to decorate such a tree that the mother of
the family had now disappeared.</p>

<p>The room in which I was hearing all this
was large and lofty, lighted by five windows,
the remaining walls being hung with ancestral
portraits; for these unassuming, domesticated
young girls were the descendants of a noble
and historical line, would not have changed
their ancient barony for a modern dukedom,
and with pardonable pride showed me
the family portraits, and gave me slight
sketches concerning the originals. The most
striking of these was certainly the full-length
picture of that old field-marshal of whom
Carlyle thus graphically writes:—“With
regard to Friedrich, the court-martial needs
no amendment from the King. The sentence
on Friedrich, a lieutenant-colonel guilty of
desertion, is from president and all members,
except two, death as by law.”</p>

<p>From this portrait we turned to that of
Frederic the Great himself—his own gift to
the family; from that prince the transition
was easy to the subject of the Seven Years
War, and we had begun planning excursions
to the different battlefields when a bell began
to ring, and changed the current of our
thoughts.</p>

<p>We rushed down a long corridor, being
joined as we went by different other members
of the household, and reached the room from
whence the blaze of light betrayed the presence
of the great tree. It was, indeed, a
giant, and formed a most imposing spectacle,
as it stood in the centre of the large room,
dazzling with variegated waxen tapers,
shimmering all over with ice-like crystals, and
decorated with gilded fruits and sweetmeats.
The base of this wonderful member of the
vegetable world was covered by a pyramid of
the tempting confectionery and gingerbread
peculiar to the province, and for which lots
had afterwards to be drawn.</p>

<p>Round the room, and overshadowed by the
mighty branches of the central tree, stood tiny
specimens of the same tribe, each standing
upon a table laden with gifts, and each destined
for a separate member of the family and
household.</p>

<p>Even I, stranger as I was, had my own little
tree and table of presents—pieces of fine Silesian
linen, a huge surprise ball,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and a pretty
gold brooch, embossed with roses and forget-me-nots,
which I cherish still in remembrance
of my first happy visit to Germany. There
were so many pretty things to admire, so many
thanks to tender, so many good wishes to
exchange, that it was growing quite late before
we could make up our minds to leave
these “halls of dazzling light” for the more
prosaic supper-room.</p>

<p>Here—as in Germany the Eve is more celebrated
(except as regards religious services)
than the Christmas Day itself—we found the
traditional dishes of Germany and of England.
In honour of Germany I had to make acquaintance
with real black bread—“Pumpernickel,”
as they call it in some parts of Germany,
sauerkraut, and raw smoked ham, all of
which at first I secretly thought odious, but
eventually grew to like very much; and in
honour of England we had plum pudding and
mince pies—the former not at all badly
cooked, the latter a dismal failure, as most
English housewives will understand when I
tell them that the cook, although adhering
strictly to the proportions of an excellent recipe,
had—for some extraordinary reasons of
his own—pounded the whole into a paste,
and enclosed it in a very thick crust, the shape
and size of a small pork pie.</p>

<p>We did not linger long after supper; for it
had been a long and fatiguing day for everyone.
As for myself, after so many interesting
and novel incidents, and so long and wearying
a journey, I was only too glad to find
myself once more in my own room, and I
slept without pause or wakening until the appearance
of the young ladies’ maid, Amalia, at
my bedside next morning with a cup of coffee
and the intimation that it was now 7.30, and
that the sledge for church-goers would be at
the door at nine o’clock.</p>

<p>We were off punctually to the time, and
after about half an hour’s drive over the hard-frozen
snow, upon which the brilliant sunshine
was streaming down, we reached the unpretending-looking
little Lutheran church. Here,
as the due of the Adel,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> we sat in a gallery all
by ourselves, and had high-backed velvet
chairs, surmounted by the baron’s coronet, and
with footstools embroidered to match; and
very strange it seemed to me to be looking
down from this pinnacle of isolated grandeur
upon the poorer congregation below.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, these wore the costume
of the province, and a charming costume too—a
short skirt of red, green, or blue serge,
with five broad bands of black velvet round
the lower edge; black velvet bodice, laced
over a full chemisette, and sleeves of white
cambric; pointed velvet cap (of the Stuart
shape), in colour matching the skirt, adorned
with heavy gold braiding, and edged with a
fluting of Silesian lace. Long gold earrings
and a broad gold plaque, set with garnets and
suspended by a slender chain round the neck,
were the ornaments worn with this costume,
and were, as I was afterwards told, handed
down as family heirlooms from mother to
child.</p>

<p>The dress of the men was, of course, less
elaborate. It consisted of dark-blue or grey
cloth suits, much adorned with silver buttons.
Both men and women wore long black stockings
and buckled shoes as part of their Sunday
garb, but on weekdays generally go barefoot.</p>

<p>Those among the congregation who abjured
these picturesque costumes and went in for
modern fashion, wore—like the gentle folk—black;
and I found to my astonishment that
black was also <i>de rigueur</i> for Confirmation and
the Holy Communion. The clergyman, a tall,
kindly-looking old man, wore a long black
gown and a wide box-pleated ruff. There was
an ebony and silver crucifix upon the altar,
which had lighted waxen tapers burning upon
it. The musical part of the service was led
by a full brass band; and, to complete my
surprise, I found it was against rule to kneel
at any time; one either sat or stood.</p>

<p>All this seemed so utterly at variance with
recognised ideas in England upon the same
subject, that I am afraid I did not much profit
by my first church-going in the Fatherland.
Still, it was an interesting experience, and
when time had familiarised me more with
both the language and the customs, I found
a great deal that I could honestly admire,
though I never ceased to prefer our own
bright and beautiful Liturgy to the somewhat
ponderous nature of worship in the Fatherland.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> wind blew fiercer than ever as Embrance
turned out of the broad avenue into a side
path, and found herself face to face with
Horace Meade.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Miss Clemon.”</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Mr. Meade.”</p>

<p>She put her hand into his for a second; he
had thrown away his cigar and turned to walk
by her side. “How fast you walk,” he said;
“I have been watching you for the last three
minutes.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t much time to lose,” said
Embrance, apologetically, “as a rule. The
park gate will shut soon.”</p>

<p>“Yes, to be sure. Do you like the
Regent’s-park?”</p>

<p>“Very much; don’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">{190}</span></p>

<p>“Oh yes, immensely, but somehow I never
come here. No, indeed, I don’t,” in answer
to her look of amusement; “I came to-day
because I thought there was a chance of
meeting you. There is something that I want
to talk to you about. Do you know that you
are the most difficult person in the world to
approach?”</p>

<p>“I should not have thought so,” said
Embrance, with a smile. “I think I can guess
what you are going to tell me.”</p>

<p>He shook his head: “I’m afraid you can’t.”</p>

<p>“You must not suppose that she means all
she says; only give her time and she will take
your advice.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes; Joan, you mean?”</p>

<p>It struck Embrance that he was very absent
and unlike himself, but she had broached the
subject now, and she felt bound to go on with
it. “She told me that she was very sorry that
she had been ungracious about some suggestion
that you made. I’m quite sure that she
would not willingly say anything to hurt
you.”</p>

<p>“I’m quite sure she would not,” assented
Horace, “she is much too kind-hearted.”</p>

<p>“And,” continued Embrance, clasping her
hands firmly in her muff, “I wanted to say
(we needn’t talk about it again), if you think
that it would be better for her to go down to
Doveton, I will try and persuade her to go;
it would not be for long, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“No, I suppose not,” said Horace, absently;
“but don’t you see, Miss Clemon, the question
is not altogether about Joan’s peace of mind,
but yours?”</p>

<p>They had reached the gate, and turned into
a dreary piece of “outer circle.”</p>

<p>“Mine?” exclaimed Embrance, growing
scarlet in the dim twilight; “there is no
occasion to talk about me.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, I have a great deal to
say. Do you suppose I don’t see what you are
doing for my cousin, how you are helping her
and teaching her, and taking on your shoulders
the responsibilities that her own family ought
to bear?”</p>

<p>“I had not looked upon it from that point
of view,” said Embrance, dryly.</p>

<p>“Now you are angry at what I have said; I
can’t help it, I can’t hold my tongue any
longer. Joan knows what I think, but
perhaps she has not told you all I said; she is
a dear little girl. Don’t imagine that I am
throwing any blame on her, but she shouldn’t
have come to London!”</p>

<p>“I have tried to do my best for her,” said
Embrance, in a broken voice.</p>

<p>“Miss Clemon,” cried Horace, “you must
think that I am behaving like a brute! Do
you suppose I don’t know that? You have
done her, and are doing her, all the good in
the world.”</p>

<p>“I thought that you did not trust me,” explained
Embrance, simply. “I’m so glad I
was wrong; indeed, Joan is like a younger
sister to me; don’t try to separate us.”</p>

<p>The light of a feeble gaslight fell upon her
face as she spoke; her eyes were raised
pleadingly to his.</p>

<p>“You have mistaken me altogether,” he
said, hurriedly, “but I couldn’t expect it to
be otherwise. You must not misunderstand
me again. Embrance, I know I am taking
you by surprise; I must say it. I love you.
I am miserable when I am away from you.
Don’t, don’t turn away!”</p>

<p>A gust of wind came roaring down the
road; she did not heed it. She walked
quietly by his side, stricken dumb with great
joy. She did not deceive herself for one
instant, it was too late for that, she liked him
too well. She could not shut her heart to the
truth, any more than she could shut her ears
to his words. Alas, alas! where were all her
plans for Joan? Did Joan love him? In
the darkness of the badly lighted road, she
seemed to see Joan’s beautiful face, and to
hear her say, “Embrance, have patience with
me. Don’t think ill of me! You are the only
one who has patience with me!”</p>

<p>“My poor dear, I will do my best for you,”
she thought, as a feeling of great tenderness
towards Joan came over her. She had no
answer ready for Horace Meade. Ah! he was
strong, and did not want her pity.</p>

<p>“What shall I say? What shall I do?”
she cried at last, in desperation. It seemed as
if hours had passed since he had spoken the
words that made this great difference in her life.</p>

<p>“Have I distressed you? I can’t help it.
Tell me, won’t you listen to me?”</p>

<p>“I, I am sorry,” she faltered, looking at
him with a tearful glance.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know. I had thought——” She
stopped; Joan’s name must not be mentioned
now if she loved him; if—nay, she must love
him, and he would find it out by-and-by; he
could not but be fond of her. Only give them
time; he was vexed with her for the moment;
it would all come right. Nevertheless it was
hard to give him her answer. “Mr. Meade,”
she said, speaking more firmly now, “it is
very good of you. I thank you very much.
I can’t listen to you; it is better not.”</p>

<p>“Are you engaged to that man who went
to New Zealand?”</p>

<p>“My cousin? No, certainly not; why
should you think so?”</p>

<p>“Joan said something about it, that is
partly why I determined to know my fate at
once.”</p>

<p>“You must have misunderstood her
altogether. When did you see her last?”</p>

<p>“About a fortnight ago. I can’t remember,”
he replied, impatiently. “I believe your whole
thoughts are wrapped up in her.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon. I didn’t mean to vex
you. Can’t we be friends, at least?”</p>

<p>Up to the present moment she had indeed
been thinking how she could best make a
reconciliation possible between him and Joan.
With a sharp pang it struck her that perhaps
after all she was in the wrong.</p>

<p>“Listen,” he said; “I am in earnest, in
bitter earnest. You believe me, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Embrance.</p>

<p>“Thank you. I was sure of that, at least.
I care so much that I can’t stay here any
longer, coming to see you like a stranger, and
having no right to help you in any way whatever.
I have seen enough in the last few
months to guess a little what your work is.
No; let me say it out to the end. Before
I knew you I fancied that you were selfish and
indifferent. Heaven knows how wrong I was!
If I can’t win your love, it is my own fault.
Embrance, don’t decide in a hurry. Think it
over. I love you. Give me a chance.”</p>

<p>They had reached the crowded thoroughfare.
Gaslights were flaring; the road was
thronged with cabs and carts; the people
were pushing along the pavement, too busy to
notice the quiet couple, or to observe that
the plain girl in an ulster had a white face,
and that the lines of her mouth were set with
pain and suffering. Across the street, in a
few minutes, they were in a dreary square. Here
there were no loiterers. A murky grey sky;
black trees, flinging their gaunt arms to the
chimney pots; rows of melancholy stone
houses, with carved heads, placidly unconcerned,
gazing down from the lintels.</p>

<p>In vain she strove to find words to tell him
her perplexity. How could she accept this
gift from his hands, believing as she did that
the child at home was longing to make friends
with him? How should she return and look
her friend in the face, saying, “I have stolen
your lover”?</p>

<p>“Embrance, be patient with me,” Joan had
said. “Embrance, don’t give me up.”</p>

<p>Then she turned and put her hand into
Horace’s. Her fingers were cold as ice, but
they did not tremble. “I can’t; don’t ask
me,” she cried under her breath.</p>

<p>He strode by her side in silence. An
empty cab came rattling round the corner.
“Stop it,” whispered Embrance. He obeyed
her, opened the door, and told the man where
to drive. He lifted his hat, standing on one
side, and waiting for the cab to drive off. At
last she raised her eyes to his. “Forgive me,”
she whispered; “do forgive me. God bless
you, Horace.”</p>

<p>He turned away without a word. What
should he say more than he had said? She
could not love him. There was nothing more
to be done. She was no coquette to say
“No” when she meant “Yes.” Fate was hard
on him. The one woman in the whole world
whom he longed to call his wife had rejected his
love. He must bear his grief as best he could.</p>

<p>Embrance sank back into a dark corner of
the cab, shuddering as she recalled his look of
misery. She had none of the spirit of a
heroine or a martyr to support her; she had
tried, struggling against her own self, to act
uprightly by one friend; suppose that her very
love of honesty had caused her to be cruel to
another? Now that it was all too late, she
longed to have the last five minutes over again.
No, a thousand times, no! Let her only get
home and have time to think, and she would
leave off being sorry. Whether rightly or
wrongly, she had done what seemed honest and
fair; she would not reproach herself, and he
would soon get over it. “Men forget sooner
than women,” she reflected, falling back on
one of her aunt’s numerous truisms. Then she
almost laughed in scorn at her own insincerity.
“You don’t believe it; you know he loves
you, and your ridiculous behaviour will make
him think worse of all womanhood from this
day forth.” “Oh! I hope not. I hope
not!” she sobbed aloud, with her head against
the cushion of the cab.</p>

<p>The sound of her own voice roused her to
the consciousness that she was getting very
near home; she sat up, dried her eyes and
smoothed her hair. It would not do to alarm
Joan; what had happened this afternoon must
be kept a secret from her at all events. She
had her own latch-key. She opened the door
and stole upstairs. The landlady and her
daughter were chatting in the back parlour,
but Embrance did not want to exchange
civilities with them just now. Outside her
own door she paused for a moment, then
opened it, saying: “Well, Joan, are you waiting
for your tea?”</p>

<p>There was no answer. The lamp was
lighted, the tablecloth was laid, but Joan was
not there. Her chair was in a corner by the
window; there were no signs of her drawing
or scraps of millinery about.</p>

<p>“Joan!” cried Embrance, nervously.
“Where are you?”</p>

<p>No answer. She ran to the door of the
next room and looked in; all was dark and
silent. “I suppose it is not so late as I
thought,” she said to herself. “She will be
in soon, I daresay.”</p>

<p>She took off her bonnet, and sat down to
wait with a book, but she could not fix her
attention. She was very, very tired, and
rather lonely; she did wish that Joan would
come. The longing to speak to somebody was
so great, that after a short time she put out her
hand and rang the bell. Annie came running
upstairs at the summons; her eyes were round
with excitement; she hardly waited to hear
Miss Clemon’s question.</p>

<p>“Did Miss Fulloch leave any message for
me when she went out?”</p>

<p>“No, miss; she’s been gone ever since ten
o’clock, half an hour after you left. I heard
the door bang, and I said to myself, ‘What’s
that?’ And it was Miss Fulloch; she had
on her new bonnet, with the pink feather, that
she was making.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">{191}</span></p>

<p>“Never mind the bonnet, Annie; did she
say when she would be in to tea?”</p>

<p>“No, miss; and I expect she won’t be back;
she took her bag.”</p>

<p>“Very well. I will wait half an hour, and
then, please, bring tea.”</p>

<p>“There’s something wrong upstairs,” was
Annie’s report in the kitchen. “Miss Clemon
looks as if she see a ghost. She isn’t half the
lady she was.”</p>

<p>Seven o’clock struck; eight o’clock, nine
o’clock, and no Joan appeared. Embrance
drank a cup of tea, but she could not eat anything.
In vain she told herself that very
likely Mrs. Rakely had made one of her flying
visits to London, and had persuaded Joan to
spend the day with her; it was absurd to be
anxious; of course she would be back
directly; nevertheless she could not read,
write, or rest. The late postman brought a
letter for Miss Clemon. Annie, having
studied the envelope on the way upstairs, saw
that the postmark was Brighton.</p>

<p>Embrance took the letter. The handwriting,
firm and neat, was quite strange to
her. She opened it hastily.</p>

<p>“Dear old Embrance” (it began). “I had
not the courage to say good-bye to you this
morning, but I told you that I had a secret,
and I think you guessed it; you are so clever.
I was afraid you would be disappointed, you
meant me to be a painter’s wife, didn’t you?
but I was happily married to Alfred Brownhill
this morning, and we are spending our
honeymoon at Brighton. We must come and
see you before we go to Doveton. Alfred
sends his kind regards; he remembers you
quite well. You will be glad to hear that I
am so happy; I hope you won’t miss me too
much, you busy old dear.—Your loving, <span class="smcap">Joan
Brownhill</span>. P.S. Alfred likes the bonnet very
much. He wrote the address; were you
mystified?”</p>

<p>A little bunch of sweet smelling violets
dropped out of the letter and scented the room—Joan
always loved flowers. She liked everything
that was pleasant and good to look upon.</p>

<p>Alfred Brownhill! he was a staid, middle-aged
man, with a comfortable home and a
prosperous income. No wonder that old Mr.
Fulloch had wished for the marriage. He
would be surprised, too, and would wonder
that his grand-daughter had not returned to
his roof, as she was prepared to follow his
advice at last. But Embrance saw clearly
enough that Joan would never have done that.
A runaway wedding, and a triumphant return
to Doveton, would be much more to her taste.
She looked at Joan’s unused cup and saucer
on the table, and she shivered as she realised
the truth; her friend would never come back.
While she had been rejecting the pleadings of
a good man who loved her, Joan had perhaps
been telling her husband that “Embrance
wished her to marry a painter.”</p>

<p>“I will write to him,” she said, turning to
the little table where she had so often sat
when he and Joan talked together over the
fire. She never swerved from her intention;
he had been cruelly treated; he might not
care to accept her apology, that did not
matter. She must see him once more, and
explain to him that she had been deceived—mistaken,
that was a more gracious word.
She would write no more than she could help.</p>

<p>“Dear Mr. Meade,—Please come and see
me. I have made a mistake.—Yours truly,
<span class="smcap">Embrance Clemon</span>.”</p>

<p>She knew his address, she had written to
him before, asking him to do various little acts
of kindness for Joan. Once she had been to
tea at his rooms, with Mrs. Rakely and Joan,
he had shown her his sketches and asked her
opinion about his pictures. It was all long
ago. It had been a bitterly cold day, Joan
had caught a bad sore throat, and was ill for a
week afterwards; she had been an impatient
invalid, and Horace had called to inquire after
her very often, and had left fruit and flowers.</p>

<p>Embrance could no longer endure the loneliness
of the little parlour; she missed Joan
terribly, her laugh and her many coaxing ways.
She longed for air; it was a good excuse for
posting the letter herself. As she tied her
bonnet-strings before the glass, she shrank
back aghast at the sight of her pale face. She
put on a thick veil and threw a shawl over her
shoulders; she would feel happier when the
letter was once in the pillar-box. A hundred
times she had been up and down the crooked
staircase in the dark; to-night, it might be
that she was tired, or that her eyes were full
of tears, but her foot slipped, she clutched
instinctively at the banister, missed it, and
fell down into the darkness below.</p>

<p>So it came about that the letter to Horace
Meade was left unposted till the following
morning.</p>

<p>Some days passed before Embrance could
leave her room; the doctor, whom the landlady
had summoned in her fright, said that she
had sprained her ankle badly, and ordered
perfect rest. The people in the house were
good to the solitary invalid; the first-floor
lodger brought her knitting and a great many
dull stories of her own youth, and experiences
of sprained ankles and broken limbs, and came
and sat by her sofa, while the landlady and
Annie were unceasing in their attentions.
Some of Embrance’s pupils called, and Joan
wrote sheets of sympathy, crossed and recrossed.
Her husband sent his kind regards
and hoped that Miss Clemon would come
down to Doveton and stay there till she
was quite convalescent. However, Embrance
refused the invitation, she would rather stay
at home for the present; later on, she would
like to visit Joan.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brownhill, in the snug breakfast-room
in her new home, fretted a little over this
refusal; then she recovered her spirits and laid
plans for summer excursions; it would be
better to have Embrance, after all, when the
roses were in bloom. Alfred Brownhill was
very much in love with his young wife, and
considered her interest in the welfare of her
sick friend the prettiest trait of character
imaginable.</p>

<p>“Poor old Embrance,” exclaimed Joan, with
her hand in his; “I should die of loneliness
in that pokey room all by myself, but she has
so much strength of will; I don’t believe she
minds a bit. I shall never be like her!”</p>

<p>“Heaven forbid!” murmured he devoutly.
He was prepared to be kind to the lady for his
wife’s sake, but he had a virtuous horror of a
strong-minded woman wrapped up in herself,
and his principles (which he held sacred) did
not allow him to disguise his feelings.</p>

<p>In the meantime Embrance recovered slowly
and went back to her work, but she received
no answer to her letter.</p>

<p>L. M. D. (Suisse).—We have no charge whatever to
make against the moral or intellectual training given
in Swiss schools, having had opportunities for making
ourselves well acquainted with some of them. But
we speak advisedly in stating that, on the score of
diet, and certain other matters, English habits differ
from those of foreign countries, and many English
constitutions cannot bear so great a change with
impunity, especially young growing girls. Thus it
is better that they should be educated at schools in
their own country; or, if abroad, should attend day
schools, or engage visiting masters, and sleep and
board at home. We have many Swiss friends, and
are partial to them and their country. We are glad
you like our paper, being one of “our girls.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Young Antiquary.</span>—The word “cromleac” is a compound
of two Irish words—viz, <i>crom</i>, “to adore,” or
“worship,” and <i>leac</i>, “a stone.” <i>Crom</i> was likewise
one of the Irish names of the supreme God.
These ancient remains are therefore very clearly
those of altars or places of worship. You would
learn all that is known of them by reading Higgins’
rare work on the round towers, etc., in the British
Museum.</p>

<h3>WORK.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span>—To tan a tennis net, soak it in boiled oil,
and let it dry under cover, hung up in the air. Your
writing is too full of flourishes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Young Mother, Helen C.</span>—Get a shilling manual
with knitting and crochet patterns. Our space cannot
be occupied by them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence Gobbler.</span>—We thank you for your communication
about hat cleaning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Courts.</span>—Clothing for Ceylon should consist of what
we here call summer clothing—white and pale-coloured
cambrics, tussore and Surah silks, very
thin cashmere, silk gauze webs for undervests, etc.
Go to an Indian outfitter’s, and you will be shown
the materials which are the most suitable.</p>

<p>T. A. and C. M.—The best dress for tricycle-riding is
a tailor-made short habit, or tight short jacket, and
a plain narrow cloth skirt, without any trimmings,
festooning, and draping.</p>

<p>C. C.—Table centres are much used for dinner parties,
but not of gathered up plush. They are made of
straight pieces of silk, German canvas, or satin
sheeting, ornmented with an appliqué of plaited
straw, or plush edged with fine cord or tinsel.</p>
</div>


<h3>MISCELLANEOUS.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p><span class="smcap">Maud.</span>—Go to the police office and inform the inspector
of your trouble and the cruel treatment to
which you are subjected, and he will take you to
the proper quarters, where you may obtain a separation
and an allowance. Do nothing rashly and
nothing wrong, be your trials and provocations
what they may. What you suggested to us would
be very wrong indeed, and we think and hope you
must have done so under great excitement. If
by word or act you thoughtlessly gave cause for
jealousy, you might not obtain the separation and
allowance, to which otherwise you could lay just
claim. Pray God to guide you and preserve you
from evil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blush Rose.</span>—<i>Requiescat in pace</i> means “Rest in
peace.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lotta.</span>—Try to live much in prayer during each day
while at your business, or in little intervals of leisure.
The responsibility of either turning to God and
accepting or “neglecting so great salvation” lies on
you. You are not a mere puppet, but a reasonable
being, and have been given to distinguish between
good and evil. “Ye <i>will</i> not come unto Me,” not
“Ye <i>shall</i> not come.” “Why will ye die?” etc.
Do not let anyone deceive you with the idea that
you have no free will. God does not unjustly
“gather where He does not strew.” He had already
given the one pound to the idle servant, and thus
supplied the means for trading, or would not have
expected any return. May He guide you aright.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kittie.</span>—Perhaps some glycerine or vaseline might
remove the roughness from your face and neck.
Get some nice nursery hairwash and apply it to the
skin of your head with a small sponge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry’s Wife.</span>—We sympathise with you in your
trouble and your sister in her sufferings. Certainly,
the prayer offered in faith, resting on God’s promises,
will certainly be answered. He who bestows faith
will accept His own gift with favour. It is He who
is drawing your heart towards Him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emma Walker.</span>—There is the Royal Free Hospital
in Gray’s-inn-road, W.C., for the relief of the sick
poor of all nations, without any letter of recommendation
or other claim beyond sickness and
destitution. Write to the secretary, James S. Blyth,
Esq. About 2,000 in-patients and 25,000 out-patients
are annually under its care.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">{192}</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice Marie.</span>—1. The 16th July, 1869, was a
Friday. 2. A series of articles on girls’ pets was
given in vol. iv., pages 83, 274, 602, and 731.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Dark Lady</span> and <span class="smcap">Sussex</span>.—When a married man
dies intestate, having children, the widow can claim
one-third of his property, and the remaining two-thirds
are divided between his children in equal
portions. If he die without children, the widow can
claim one-half of his property, and the rest is divided
in equal portions between his nearest of kin.
“Sussex” is quite wrong in his ideas respecting a
brother’s claims taking precedence of those of the
widow and the children, and it would be most unjust
if such were the law. The “Dark Lady” writes
well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Priscilla.</span>—Your digestion needs attention, and perhaps
your diet and mode of life. If you get a bad
headache whenever you read for long at a time, why
do you attempt it? Read a little from time to time,
and rest your eyes and the feeble nerves connected
with the brain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adelaide.</span>—What you name are designed as acts
expressing respect and veneration for Him whom we
worship on bended knee. We cannot enter more
fully into the subject of your letter. We have no
remembrance of any letter signed “Ade.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Antoinette R.</span> informs us that “she is pretty,” and
that gentlemen whom she serves in her father’s shop
“stare at her as if she were an unseen object.” (?)
We fail to understand what that means. She should
resolutely try to forget herself, and give her whole
attention to selling her father’s gloves, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Julia F. E.</span> must count the feet of her verses, so
as to get them even. It will not do to have
nine feet in one line and eight in another.
“Heaven” and “driven” do not rhyme, and
in the poem to a “Skylark” here are many
mistakes in the length of the feet. But, after
all, to an invalid the pleasure of writing
down the “thoughts that oppress” and “the
words which burn” is very great, and the
relief is excellent both for brain and the
feelings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">An English Voice from Ireland.</span>—We
certainly could not advise you to marry under
the circumstances that you “neither love nor
respect” the man to whom you have promised
your hand. Perhaps you do not know your
own mind, and had better ask to wait a year
before you decide finally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion, Newcastle.</span>—The new volume of the
G. O. P. begins with the November part. You
could improve your writing by crossing your
“t’s” and dotting your “i’s.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rilly.</span>—The Malvern Home of Rest might suit
you. Particulars may be had from the Hon.
Mrs. Hewett, Barnard’s Green, Great Malvern.
There is also Fern House, Coleshill, Warwickshire,
standing high, having a large garden,
etc. Apply for terms to Miss Price, Fern House,
Coleshill, Warwickshire. We think that one
of these might suit you. If a boarder were
willing to share a bedroom, the charge would
be 17s. per week, everything included except
washing, which would be 9d. a dozen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Annie.</span>—The office of the Poor Clergy Relief
Corporation, an institution intended to give
aid in temporary distress to them, their
widows, or orphans, is at 36, Southampton-street,
Strand, W.C.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thyra</span> and <span class="smcap">Cassy</span>.—There is no “usual time”
for giving answers. There is very little space
allowed for putting them in. In reference to
your question, the use of tweezers and pumice-stone
is all that we can recommend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Auntie Laurie.</span>—Your parents’ objection to
an engagement with the man you name is
fully justified by his conduct. The fact that
he has endeavoured to induce you, a minor,
to rebel against them and “marry him secretly,”
shows him to be devoid of all honour and
right principle. He is taking a disgraceful advantage
of your youth, weakness, and inexperience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maude Scott.</span>—1. When a cemetery is closed it is
generally because the neighbourhood has become
overcrowded near it. We never heard of a cemetery
being re-opened. 2. The colours of the hoods worn
by clergymen and their linings show the university
or college from which they come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Perplexed One.</span>—We know of no remedy so good
as golden ointment. But why not consult a doctor,
as your house and its surroundings must be in
fault?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Scotchwoman.</span>—“Edward Garrett” is the <i>nom de
plume</i> under which Isabella Fyvie Mayo has written
several popular works, amongst others, “Occupations
of a Retired Life,” and “Premiums Paid to Experience.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Virginia Maud.</span>—We could not answer your letter at
the length you desire, as we have no space in our
columns. We should advise you to write to the
secretary, Girls’ Friendly Society, central office, 3,
Victoria Mansions, Victoria-street, Westminster,
S.W., with a view to joining the Girls’ Friendly
Society, which will offer you all the aid and information
you may require.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lily.</span>—Ten extra summer and Christmas numbers have
now been published.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hermon’s Servant.</span>—Ember Week is a corruption
of <i>Quatuor tempora</i>, through the Dutch <i>Quatemper</i>
and German <i>Quatember</i>. The four times are after
Quadragesima Sunday, Whit Sunday, Holyrood
Day (September), and St. Lucia’s Day (December).
The ancient belief that persons sat in embers or
ashes on those days is without foundation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rance</span> and <span class="smcap">Gypsy</span>.—Canaries’ claws when too long
can be cut with a small pair of sharp scissors, but
it is a very delicate business to perform.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Portia.</span>—Your sending out cards of thanks for kind
inquiries is an intimation that you are prepared to
receive the visits of the friends who made them.
That will decide the time for you. Until you send
the cards, they would be most indiscreet and intrusive
in calling, unless the very nearest relations,
or an exceptionally intimate and privileged friend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rowena.</span>—It is a fixed and general rule that for a girl
to ride out only with a riding master is very far
from expedient. Of course, if he were an uncle or
brother, or a very old and respectable married man,
the objection would be lessened, especially if riding
up and down the sea sands in full sight, instead of
taking a country ride out of sight. There should
always be a second lady or a brother, though quite
young.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerboa</span> is thanked for her kind letter, and the Editor
feels much obliged to those who proposed his health
at the dinner party “Jerboa” attended. She makes
the tails of her letters too long below the lines.
Those above are of a suitable and prettier length.
Make them correspond.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Priscilla</span> may probably outgrow her headaches, as
she is so young. They may arise from various
causes. Thus, we could not prescribe without due
acquaintance with her constitution and many surrounding
circumstances.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p class="center">A COQUETTE.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Louie.</span>—Your informant was right, and probably
drew his information from Major A. B. Ellis’s work,
entitled “West African Islands,” published last year.
Canaries have no song in their wild state; it is of
artificial origin, and the song our birds give us in no
way resembles their natural shrill chirp. They are
placed in cages near those of birds already trained to
sing, and when accustomed to imprisonment they
strive hard to imitate the notes of their educated
fellows. The natives of the Canary Islands keep a
large stock on hand in process of training. The
young of those trained and taught naturally learn
from the parent birds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ella Brown.</span>—The statue of the Venus de Medici is
only 4 feet 11½ inches in height. It is believed to
be the production of Cleomenes, of Athens, of the
second century. It was exhumed in the seventh
century near Tivoli, in the villa of Hadrian, and
was removed in 1680, by Cosmo III., to the Imperial
Gallery at Florence, from the Medici Palace at
Rome. It was broken into eleven pieces when discovered,
all in a perfect state, one arm only missing,
which has been added.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twin Sisters.</span>—The 5th of June, 1876, was a Monday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. of Rudolstadt</span>, <span class="smcap">Ida</span>, and <span class="smcap">Stella</span>.—We are inundated
with verses from girls, young and untaught;
and, as a rule, the same opinion and criticism would
be suitable for all alike. But in the case of “Ida’s”
verses there is some promise of better to come; as,
at least, she has a good ear for rhythm. Our young
friend with the long name should count the feet and
make each line correspond with its fellow, observing
where the beat falls in every line, and placing it
uniformly on the same syllable in each verse. Those
that follow her first verse neither correspond with it
in feet nor in the beat. Though quite incorrect,
there is some little poetic feeling in “Stella’s”
lines.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vevey.</span>—We are much obliged for your article, but
are unable to give it a place in our columns owing to
lack of space.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lulu.</span>—Consult our series of articles on “Good Breeding,”
and “The Habits of Polite Society.” At page
314, vol. ii., you will find “Dinners in Society,” and
from this you can glean all the information you
require. You only show your good sense in making
inquiries when unacquainted with any subject.
There is nothing to be ashamed of in so doing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bulb.</span>—You should put out a good-sized barrel or tub
to catch any rainfall in a garden, backyard, or on the
leads, where accessible, and use it at least for the
face and hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lily Leaves.</span>—To prevent moths from eating your
clothes in the summer, keep them constantly brushed
and aired. Camphor, Keating’s powder, or sandal-wood
shavings should be placed about all clothing
that is kept in boxes and cupboards. The 23rd of
September, 1867, was a Monday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Millicent Leigh.</span>—St. Catharine was a virgin martyr,
who suffered at Alexandria under Maximin in 307,
and whose relics were said to have been miraculously
conveyed to Mount Sinai, where they
are preserved in a monastery. The celebrated
Duchess of Devonshire was the youngest
daughter of John, Earl of Spencer, born, June,
1757; died, March, 1806. Her beauty, wit, and
audacity made her one of the most celebrated
women of her day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Ward in Chancery.</span>—Rice thrown at a bride
is a relic of the <i>panis farreus</i> in the most
honourable form of marriage amongst the ancient
Romans, and it was called <i>Confarreatio</i>.
Orange blossoms were first worn by Saracen
brides, but the modern custom of wearing them
is a fashion introduced by dressmakers, and
is referrable to the “language of flowers.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Armistice.</span>—The redness of the scar can only
be removed by time. Nature has produced
a new skin, but, like that of a new-born infant,
it is tender and red. Leave it alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maud Kinsley.</span>—<i>Au revoir</i> is the French for “to
see again,” and is pronounced as “o-rev-voir,”
and <i>retroussé</i> means “turned up,” or “tucked
up,” and is pronounced as “re-troo-say.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anahuac</span> (Mexico).—The individual who is
desirous of being naturalised as a British subject
should have resided seven years in Great
Britain. Did the applicant do so when being
educated in England? Children belong to the
father’s nationality, not the mother’s. The
British consul would give all necessary instructions
and assistance.</p>

<p>T. M. B.—Your nice letter deserves a kindly
acknowledgment. You may send as much as
would fill a sheet of notepaper as a specimen
of your style and originality of ideas, and
we shall hope to give you our opinion, as you
desire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Will’s Darling.</span>—We do not know how to
advise you, save to marry and live with your
aged grandmother. You cannot possibly leave
her, and in all probability she will be glad to
have you comfortably settled with a kind husband
before she is called away. Your writing
is rather careless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shiny Face.</span>—It is not the so-called working
men whose wives enter learned professions and
neglect home duties. They enter public-houses
instead. The complete monopoly of almost
all occupations for bread-earning for such a length of
time by men could not continue amongst an ever-increasing
population; so many suitable fields of
intellectual and manual work have been shut out
from women by their “natural protectors.” It is
sad to see the latter selling tapes and ribbons
behind counters. They can be clergymen, schoolmasters,
soldiers, sailors, emigrants to prepare new
settlements, lumberers, navvies, engine-drivers,
stokers, mechanics, chimney sweepers, masons, etc.,
and the women will leave all such work to them.
But dairy, fruit, flower, poultry, and other farming
may be very suitably directed by women; also printing,
binding, engraving, designing, china painting,
and very many other ways of bread-earning should
be equally open to them as to men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roseleaf.</span>—An ell (cloth measure) was fixed at 45
inches by Henry I., <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1101. The word is derived
from <i>ulna</i>, “the arm,” although much longer than
that member; but even now measurements are made
by it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Adelaide.</span>—Edelweiss is pronounced as “A-dle-vice.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anxious One.</span>—Lessons can be had to cure stammering.
Fill your lungs well with air, and consider
what you wish to say before you speak. Make
your sentences very short, and open your mouth
well. When alone, read aloud, and beat time with
your foot or hand regularly at every second
syllable.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
